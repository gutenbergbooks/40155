<h2 class="main">Introductory Life of Akbar.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The object of the Romance which is now presented to
English readers, in a translated form, is to convey a generally
accurate idea of the court of Akbar, the greatest and best native ruler
that ever held sway over Hindustan. The author, Dr. Van
Limburg-Brouwer, was an oriental scholar, who strove, by this means, to
impart to others the knowledge he had himself acquired, through the
study of contemporary writers, of the thoughts and habits of the great
Emperor, and of the manners and civilization of those who surrounded
him.</p>
<p>If he has attained any measure of success in this attempt, his
labours will certainly have been useful, and his work deserves
translation. For on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e162" href=
"#xd20e162" name="xd20e162">vi</a>]</span>Englishmen, more than on any
other people, is a knowledge of so important a period of Indian history
incumbent. This romance of Akbar is, it is true, but a sketch, and is
only intended to excite interest in the subject. But if it has that
effect, and leads to further inquiry and research, it will secure the
object with which it was written, and will have done useful
service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Akbar, an Eastern Romance,&rdquo; (&ldquo;<span lang=
"nl">Akbar, een Oostersche Roman,</span>&rdquo;) was first published in
Dutch, at the Hague, in 1872, the year before the author&rsquo;s
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e169src" href="#xd20e169" name=
"xd20e169src">1</a> A German translation appeared at Leipzig in
1877.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e175src" href="#xd20e175" name=
"xd20e175src">2</a> A native of Holland might not unnaturally undertake
such a work, for the best European contemporary account of the reign of
Akbar was written by a Dutchman, Pieter Van den Broeck.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e181src" href="#xd20e181" name=
"xd20e181src">3</a></p>
<p>Students of Indian history are looking forward <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e189" href="#xd20e189" name=
"xd20e189">vii</a>]</span>to the publication of the Life of Akbar by
Prince Frederick of Schleswig Holstein. A really good biography of so
great a ruler will be a work of the highest importance, and the
Prince&rsquo;s proved literary skill<a class="noteref" id="xd20e191src"
href="#xd20e191" name="xd20e191src">4</a> and thoroughness in research
justify the anticipation that his Life of Akbar will be worthy of the
subject. The romance by Van Limburg-Brouwer, in its English dress, will
answer its purpose if it gives rise to a desire for more full and
complete information in a graver form, and thus serves as an <i lang=
"fr">avant courier</i> to the life of Akbar by Prince Frederick.</p>
<p>The epoch of Akbar is the one of greatest importance to English
students of the history of India, for two reasons. It is the period
when administration under native rule was best and most efficient, and
it is, consequently, the one with which a comparison with British rule
should be made. It is also the period of which the most detailed and
exact accounts have been written <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e202" href="#xd20e202" name="xd20e202">viii</a>]</span>and
preserved; so that such a comparison will be reliable and useful.</p>
<p>A brief introductory notice of the great Emperor&rsquo;s life may,
perhaps, be acceptable to readers of Van <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e206" title=
"Source: Limburg Brouwer&rsquo;s">Limburg-Brouwer&rsquo;s</span>
historical romance. Akbar was the third Indian sovereign of the House
of Timur. Hindustan had been ruled by Afghans for two centuries and a
half<a class="noteref" id="xd20e209src" href="#xd20e209" name=
"xd20e209src">5</a> when Baber crossed the Indus and founded the
Mughal<a class="noteref" id="xd20e221src" href="#xd20e221" name=
"xd20e221src">6</a> Empire in 1525. Baber died in the Charbagh at Agra,
on December 26th, 1530, and his son and successor, Humayun, was
defeated and driven out of India by the able and determined Afghan
chief, Shir Shah, in 1540. Shir Shah died on the throne, and was
succeeded by a son and grandson, while Humayun took refuge with
Tahmasp, the Shah of Persia. The restored Afghans kept their power for
fifteen years. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e224" href="#xd20e224"
name="xd20e224">ix</a>]</span></p>
<p>The story of Humayun&rsquo;s flight is told by his faithful ewer
bearer, named Jauhar, who accompanied him in his exile.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e227src" href="#xd20e227" name=
"xd20e227src">7</a></p>
<p>Jauhar tells us that, in October 1542, a little party of seven or
eight horsemen and a few camels was wearily journeying over the sandy
wastes of Sind, worn out with fatigue, and famished with thirst. The
fugitive Prince Humayun, his wife the youthful Hamida,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e232src" href="#xd20e232" name="xd20e232src">8</a>
the ewer bearer Jauhar, an officer named Rushen Beg, and a few others,
formed the party. Extreme misery had destroyed alike the differences of
rank and the power of concealing the true character. When
Rushen&rsquo;s horse was worn out, he insisted upon taking one which he
had lent to the Queen, a young girl of fifteen within a few days of her
confinement. Humayun gave his own horse to his wife, walked some
distance, and then got on a baggage camel. A few hours afterwards the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e235" href="#xd20e235" name=
"xd20e235">x</a>]</span>forlorn wanderers entered the fort of Amarkot,
near Tatta, which is surrounded by a dreary waste of sand-hills. Here,
under the shade of an <i>arka</i> tree,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e240src" href="#xd20e240" name="xd20e240src">9</a> young Hamida
gave birth to a prince, who afterwards became the most enlightened
thinker, and the ablest administrator of his age. Akbar was born on the
14th of October 1542. Jauhar, by Humayun&rsquo;s order, brought a pod
of musk, which the fugitive king broke and distributed among his
followers, saying, &ldquo;This is all the present I can afford to make
you on the birth of my son, whose fame, I trust, will one day be
expanded all over the world, as the perfume of the musk now fills this
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fugitives then fled up the Bolan Pass, and the little Akbar
remained for some time in the hands of his turbulent uncles at Kandahar
and Kabul, while his parents took refuge at the court of Persia. Then
the wheel of fortune turned. Assisted by Bairam Khan, a very able
general <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e250" href="#xd20e250" name=
"xd20e250">xi</a>]</span>and a native of Badakshan, Humayun fought his
way back into military possession of Lahore and Delhi, and died in
1556, leaving his inheritance, such as it was, to his young son.</p>
<p>At the time of his father&rsquo;s death, Akbar was only in his
fifteenth year. He was then in the Punjab, with Bairam Khan, putting
down the last efforts of the Afghan faction. Bairam Khan became Regent,
and remained in power until 1560, when the young King assumed the
sovereignty.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the full extent of Akbar&rsquo;s
achievements, it must be considered that he had to conquer his
dominions first, before he could even think of those great
administrative improvements which signalized the latter part of his
life and immortalized his name. In his first year he possessed the
Punjab, and the country round Delhi and Agra; in the third year he
acquired Ajmir; in the fourth, Gwalior and Oudh; and in 1572 he
conquered Gujrat, Bengal, and Bihar; but it took several years before
order could be established in those countries. Orissa was annexed to
Akbar&rsquo;s empire in 1578, by Todar Mall, who made a revenue survey
of the province in 1582. In 1581 Kabul submitted, and was placed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e257" href="#xd20e257" name=
"xd20e257">xii</a>]</span>under the rule of Akbar&rsquo;s brother,
Mirza Hakim. Kashmir was annexed in 1586,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e259src" href="#xd20e259" name="xd20e259src">10</a> Sind in 1592,
and in 1594 Kandahar was recovered from the Persians. In 1595 Akbar
commenced a long war with the Muhammadan Kings of the Dakhin, ending in
the acquisition of Berar. These wars, which were spread over nearly the
whole of Akbar&rsquo;s reign, need not further engage our attention.
But in contemplating the reforms of this admirable prince, it must be
borne in mind that their merit is enhanced by the fact that most of
them were effected during troublous times, and at periods when there
must have been great pressure on his finances. He was a renowned
warrior, skilled in all warlike exercises, and an able and successful
general. But it is not these qualities which raise Akbar so far above
the common herd of rulers. His greatness consists in his enlightened
toleration, in his love of learning, in his justice and magnanimity,
and in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e262" href="#xd20e262"
name="xd20e262">xiii</a>]</span>success with which he administered a
vast empire. The excellence of his instruments is one striking proof of
his capacity and genius.</p>
<p>The commencement of Akbar&rsquo;s intellectual revolution dates from
the introduction to him of Faizi and Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, the illustrious
sons of Mubarak. Their father, Shaikh Mubarak, traced his descent from
an Arabian dervish, of Yemen, who settled in Sind. The Shaikh was a man
of genius and great learning, and, having established himself at Agra,
gave his two sons excellent educations. Faizi, the eldest, was born in
1545. He first went to court in 1568, at the age of twenty-three, and
soon became the Emperor&rsquo;s constant companion and friend. In 1589
he was made Poet Laureate, and he was employed on several diplomatic
missions. He was a man of profound learning and original genius. He was
loved by the Emperor, who was thrown into the deepest grief at his
death, which took place at the age of fifty, on October 5th, 1595.
&ldquo;Shaikh J&iacute;o,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I have brought
Hakim Ali with me, will you not speak to me?&rdquo; Getting no answer,
in his grief he threw his turban on the ground, and wept aloud.</p>
<p>Shaikh Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, called Allami, the younger <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e268" href="#xd20e268" name=
"xd20e268">xiv</a>]</span>son of Mubarak, was born on January 14th,
1551, at Agra. He zealously studied under the care of his father; and
in his seventeenth year, towards the end of 1574, he was presented to
the Emperor Akbar by his brother Faizi.</p>
<p>Owing to the birth of his eldest surviving son Salim, at Sikri, in
1570, Akbar had made that place a royal abode. He built a palace and
other splendid edifices there, and it became one of his favourite
places of residence. It was called Fathp&uacute;r Sikri. Thither Akbar
went after his campaign in Bihar in 1574, and there his intimacy with
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl commenced. It was at this time that the memorable
Thursday evening discussions began. Akbar&rsquo;s resolution was to
rule with even hand men of all creeds in his dominions, and he was
annoyed by the intolerance and casuistry of the <i>Ulamas</i> or
learned men of the predominant religion. He himself said, &ldquo;I have
seen that God bestows the blessings of His gracious providence upon all
His creatures without distinction. Ill should I discharge the duties of
my station were I to withhold my indulgence from any of those committed
to my charge.&rdquo; But he invited the opinions of others on religious
points, and hence these discussions arose. Akbar caused a building
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e275" href="#xd20e275" name=
"xd20e275">xv</a>]</span>to be erected in the royal garden of
Fathp&uacute;r Sikri for the learned men, consisting of four halls,
called <i>aiw&aacute;n</i>, where he passed one night in the week in
their company. The western hall was set apart for Seyyids, the south
for Ulamas, the north for Shaikhs, and the east for nobles and others
whose tastes were in unison with those of the Emperor. The building was
called <i>Ibadat-Khana</i>, and here discussions were carried on, upon
all kinds of instructive and useful topics.</p>
<p>Besides Faizi and Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, there were many learned men in
constant attendance on the Emperor. Their father, Shaikh Mubarak, was a
poet, and a profound scholar. Mulla Abdul Kadir, called El Badauni, was
born at Badaun, in 1540, and studied music, astronomy, and history. He
was employed to translate Arabic and Sanscrit works into Persian; but
he was a fanatical Muhammadan, and in his &ldquo;Tarikh-i
Badauni,&rdquo; a history brought down to 1595, he always speaks of
Faizi and Ab&uacute;-l Fazl as heretics, and all references to the
speculations of Akbar and his friends are couched in bitter and
sarcastic terms. He, however, temporized, and did not allow his
religion to interfere with his worldly interests. His history contains
much original matter. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e285" href=
"#xd20e285" name="xd20e285">xvi</a>]</span>also translated the great
Hindu epic &ldquo;Mahabharata&rdquo; in 1582, and the
&ldquo;Ramayana&rdquo; between 1583 and 1591. Of the former poem he
says, &ldquo;At its puerile absurdities the eighteen thousand creations
may well be amazed. But such is my fate, to be employed on such works!
Nevertheless, I console myself with the reflection that what is
predestined must come to pass.&rdquo; The Khwaja Nizamu-d din Ahmad was
another historian of Akbar&rsquo;s court. He also was a good, but not a
bitter Musalman. His &ldquo;Tabakat-i Akbari&rdquo; is a history of the
Muhammadan Kings of Hindustan from Mahmud of Ghazni to the year 1594,
which was that of his own death. Other historians of the reign were
Shaikh Illahdad Faizi Sirhindi, whose &ldquo;Akbar-nama&rdquo; comes
down to 1602; Maulana Ahmad, of Tatta, who compiled the &ldquo;Tarikh-i
Alfi,&rdquo; under the Emperor&rsquo;s own superintendence, and Asad
Beg, who related the murder of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl and the death of
Akbar, bringing his narrative down to 1608. The greatest settlement
officer and financier of Akbar&rsquo;s court was Todar Mall. There were
also poets, musicians, and authors of commentaries who were encouraged
by the liberality of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Professors of all creeds were invited to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e289" href="#xd20e289" name=
"xd20e289">xvii</a>]</span>court of this enlightened sovereign, and
cordially welcomed. Among these were Maulana Muhammad, of Yazd, a
learned Shiah; Nuruddin Tarkhan, of Jam, in Khurasan, a mathematician
and astronomer; Sufi philosophers, fire-worshippers from Gujrat,
Brahmans, and the Christian missionaries Aquaviva, Monserrato, and
Henriquez.</p>
<p>The Thursday evening meetings at the <i>Ibadat Khana</i>, near the
tank called <i>An&uacute;ptalao</i>, in the gardens of Fathp&uacute;r
Sikri, were commenced in 1574. Akbar was at first annoyed by the
intolerance of the Muhammadan Ulamas, and encouraged the telling of
stories against them. Quarrels were the consequence. On one occasion
Akbar said to Badauni, &ldquo;In future report to me any one of the
assembly whom you find speaking improperly, and I will have him turned
out.&rdquo; Badauni said quietly to his neighbour, Asaf Khan,
&ldquo;According to this a good many would be expelled.&rdquo; His
Majesty asked what had been said, and when Badauni told him, he was
much amused, and repeated it to those who were near him. Decorum was,
however, enforced after this, and the more bigoted Muhammadans had to
curb their violence. But their feelings were very bitter when they saw
their sovereign gradually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e299" href=
"#xd20e299" name="xd20e299">xviii</a>]</span>adopting opinions which
they looked upon as more and more heretical, and at last embracing a
new religion.</p>
<p>El Badauni says that Akbar, encouraged by his friends Faizi and
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, gradually lost faith, and that in a few years not a
trace of Muhammadan feeling was left in his heart. He was led into free
thinking by the large number of learned men of all denominations and
sects that came from various countries to his court. Night and day
people did nothing but inquire and investigate. Profound points of
science, the <span class="corr" id="xd20e303" title=
"Source: subtilties">subtleties</span> of revelation, the curiosities
of history, the wonders of nature, were incessantly discussed. His
Majesty collected the opinions of every one, retaining whatever he
approved, and rejecting what was against his disposition, or ran
counter to his wishes. Thus a faith, based on some elementary
principles, fixed itself in his heart; and, as the result of all the
influences that were brought to bear on him, the conviction gradually
established itself in his mind that there were truths in all religions.
If some true knowledge was everywhere to be found, why, he thought,
should truth be confined to one religion? Thus his speculations became
bolder. &ldquo;Not a day passed,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e306" href="#xd20e306" name="xd20e306">xix</a>]</span>exclaims El
Badauni, &ldquo;but a new fruit of this loathsome tree ripened into
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length Akbar established a new religion, which combined the
principal features of Hinduism with the sun-worship of the
Pars&iacute;s.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e310src" href="#xd20e310"
name="xd20e310src">11</a> The good parts of all religions were
recognized, and perfect toleration was established. The new faith was
called <i>Tauhid-i Ilahi</i>, divine monotheism. A document was
prepared and signed by the Ulamas, the draft of which was in the
handwriting of Shaikh Mubarak. The Emperor, as <i>Imam-i Adil</i> (just
leader) and <i>Mujtahid</i>, was declared to be infallible, and
superior to all doctors in matters of faith.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e322src" href="#xd20e322" name="xd20e322src">12</a> Ab&uacute;-l
Fazl was the chief expounder of the new creed.</p>
<p>Had Akbar, as a private individual, avowed the opinions which he
formed as an Emperor, his life would not have been worth a day&rsquo;s
purchase; but in his exalted station he was enabled to practise as a
ruler the doctrines which he held as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e327" href="#xd20e327" name="xd20e327">xx</a>]</span>philosopher.
Or, as Ab&uacute;-l Fazl puts it: &ldquo;When a person in private
station unravels the warp and woof of the veil of deception, and
discovers the beautiful countenance of consistency and truth, he keeps
silence from the dread of savage beasts in human form, who would brand
him with the epithets of infidel and blasphemer, and probably deprive
him of life. But when the season arrives for the revelation of truth, a
person is endowed with this degree of knowledge upon whom God bestows
the robes of royalty, such as is the Emperor of our time.&rdquo; The
disputations came to an end in 1579, and Akbar held the new creed to
the end of his life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Akbar&rsquo;s learned men were engaged in compilations and
translations from Arabic and Sanscrit into Persian. The history called
&ldquo;Tarikh-i Alfi&rdquo; was to be a narrative of the thousand years
of Islam from the <i>Hijrah</i> to 1592 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
Akbar held that Islam would cease to exist in the latter year, having
done its work. The &ldquo;Tarikh-i Alfi&rdquo; was intended to be its
epitaph. It was chiefly written by Maulava Ahmad, of Tatta, but
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl and others assisted. Faizi translated the Sanscrit
mathematical work called &ldquo;Lilawati&rdquo;; and, as has already
been said, Badauni, with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e337"
href="#xd20e337" name="xd20e337">xxi</a>]</span>aid of others, prepared
translated versions of the two great Hindu epics.</p>
<p>But the most famous literary work of Akbar&rsquo;s reign was the
history written by Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, in three volumes, called the
&ldquo;Akbar-namah.&rdquo; The first volume contains a history of the
House of Timur down to the death of Humayun; the second is a record of
the reign of Akbar, from 1556 to 1602; and the third is the
&ldquo;Ain-i Akbari,&rdquo; the great Administration Report of
Akbar&rsquo;s Empire.</p>
<p>The first book of the &ldquo;Ain-i Akbari&rdquo; treats of the
Emperor, and of his household and court. Here we are introduced to the
royal stables, to the wardrobe, and kitchens, and to the hunting
establishment. We are initiated into all the arrangements connected
with the treasury and the mint, the armoury,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e344src" href="#xd20e344" name="xd20e344src">13</a> and the
travelling equipage. In this book, too, we learn the rules of court
etiquette, and also the ceremonies instituted by Akbar as the spiritual
guide of his people.</p>
<p>The second book gives the details of army administration, the
regulations respecting the feasts, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e349" href="#xd20e349" name="xd20e349">xxii</a>]</span>marriage
rites, education, and amusements. This book ends with a list of the
Grandees of the Empire.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e351src" href=
"#xd20e351" name="xd20e351src">14</a> Their rank is shown by their
military commands, as <i>mansabdars</i> or captains of cavalry. All
commands above five thousand belonged to the Shah-zadahs or
Emperor&rsquo;s sons. The total number of <i>mansabs</i> or military
commands was sixty-six. Most of the higher officers were Persians or
Afghans, not Hindustani Muhammadans, and out of the four hundred and
fifteen mansabdars there were fifty-one Hindus, a large percentage. It
was to the policy of Hindu generals that Akbar owed the permanent
annexation of Orissa.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e360src" href=
"#xd20e360" name="xd20e360src">15</a></p>
<p>The third book is devoted to regulations for the judicial and
executive departments, the survey and assessment, and the rent-roll of
the great finance minister. The fourth book treats of the social
condition and literary activity of the Hindus; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e365" href="#xd20e365" name=
"xd20e365">xxiii</a>]</span>and the fifth contains the moral and
epigrammatic sentences of the Emperor.</p>
<p>It is to the third book, containing the details of the revenue
system, that the modern administrator will turn with the deepest
interest. Early in his reign Akbar remitted or reduced a number of
vexatious taxes.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e369src" href="#xd20e369"
name="xd20e369src">16</a> His able revenue officers then proceeded to
introduce a reformed settlement based on the indigenous scheme, as
matured by Shir Shah. The greatest among Akbar&rsquo;s fiscal statesmen
was Todar Mall, who settled Gujrat, Bengal, and Bihar, and introduced
the system of keeping revenue accounts in Persian. Next to him was
Nizam Ahmad, the author of the &ldquo;Tabakat-i Akbari,&rdquo; who
spent his life in the Emperor&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>From time immemorial a share in the produce of land has been the
property of the State in all eastern countries. From this source the
main part of the revenue has been raised, and the land tax has always
formed the most just, the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e393"
href="#xd20e393" name="xd20e393">xxiv</a>]</span>reliable, and the most
popular means of providing for the expenditure of the government. In
Muhammadan countries this land tax is called <i>khiraj</i>, and is of
two kinds, the one <i>mukasimah</i>, when a share of the actual produce
was taken, and the other <i>wazifa</i>, which was due from the land
whether there was any produce or not.</p>
<p>In Hindu times, and before the reign of Akbar, the <i>khiraj</i> in
India was <i>mukasimah</i>. The Emperor&rsquo;s officers adopted the
system of <i>wazifa</i> for good land, and carried the settlement into
effect with great precision and accuracy in each province of his
dominions. Bengal and part of Bihar, Berar, and part of Gujrat,
however, appear to have been assessed according to the value of the
crops, the surveys of the land not being complete. Akbar took one-third
of the estimated value, and he left the option of payment in kind to
the farmers, except in the case of sugar-cane and other expensive
crops.</p>
<p>The lands were divided into four classes, with different revenue to
be paid by each, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Land cultivated every harvest, and never fallow.</p>
<p>2. Land lying fallow at intervals. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e421" href="#xd20e421" name="xd20e421">xxv</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. Land lying fallow for four years together.</p>
<p>4. Land not cultivated for five years and upwards.</p>
<p>The principle of <i>wazifa</i> was only applied to the two first of
these classes of land, and to the second only when actually under
cultivation. The lands of these two classes were divided into good,
middling, and bad. The produce of a <i>bigah</i> (5/8 of an acre) of
each sort was added together, and a third of that was considered to be
the average produce. One-third was the share of the State, as settled
by Akbar&rsquo;s assessment. Large remissions were allowed on the two
inferior classes of land. The settlements were for ten years. In about
1596 the land revenue derived from the fifteen <i>subahs</i> or
provinces of Akbar&rsquo;s empire was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A later return, referred to by Mr. Thomas, gives Akbar&rsquo;s land
revenue at &pound;16,582,440. Under his grandson, Shah Jahan, it
increased to &pound;22,000,000, and Aurangzib&rsquo;s land revenue, in
1707, was upwards of &pound;30,000,000.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e566src" href="#xd20e566" name="xd20e566src">18</a> <span class=

<p>On an average about a twentieth is deducted for
<i>jagh&iacute;rs</i>, or rent-free lands, and <i>sayurghals</i> or
assignments for charitable purposes.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ain-i Akbari&rdquo; of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl is rendered
valuable not only by the varied information it contains, but also by
the trustworthiness of the author. Mr. Blochmann says that Ab&uacute;-l
Fazl has been too often accused by European writers of flattery, and of
wilful concealment of facts damaging to the reputation of his master.
He bears witness that a study of the &ldquo;Akbar-namah&rdquo; has
convinced him that the charge is absolutely unfounded. Ab&uacute;-l
Fazl&rsquo;s love of truth, and his correctness of information are
apparent on every page of his great work.</p>
<p>The last years of the reign of Akbar were clouded with sorrow. His
eldest son, Salim, was dissipated, ungrateful, and rebellious, and bore
special hatred against his father&rsquo;s noble minister. The two
younger sons died early from the effects of drink. &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo;
exclaimed Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, &ldquo;that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e584" href="#xd20e584" name="xd20e584">xxviii</a>]</span>wine
should be burdened with suffering, and that its sweet nectar should be
a deadly poison!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e586src" href=
"#xd20e586" name="xd20e586src">19</a></p>
<p>In 1597 Ab&uacute;-l Fazl left the court, and went for the first
time on active service in the Dakhin. He had been absent for more than
four years, when the rebellious conduct of Salim, the heir apparent,
induced Akbar to recall his trusty minister. His presence was urgently
needed. Ab&uacute;-l Fazl hurriedly set out for Agra, only accompanied
by a few men. Salim thought this an excellent opportunity of getting
rid of his father&rsquo;s faithful friend, and bribed Rajah Bir Singh,
a Bundela chief of Urchah, through whose territory he would have to
pass, to waylay him. On the 12th of August 1602, at a distance of a few
miles from Narwar, Bir Singh&rsquo;s men came in sight. The minister
thought it a disgrace to fly, which he might easily have done. He
defended himself bravely, but, pierced by the lance of a trooper,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e594" href="#xd20e594" name=
"xd20e594">xxix</a>]</span>he fell dead on the ground. The assassin
sent the head of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl to his employer; and Akbar, with all
the diligence of his officers and troops, was never able to secure and
punish the murderer. His own son was the greater criminal of the two,
and in his memoirs Salim confesses his guilt with unblushing
effrontery.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e596src" href="#xd20e596" name=
"xd20e596src">20</a></p>
<p>Mr. Blochmann thus sums up the career of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl.
&ldquo;As a writer he is unrivalled. Everywhere in India he is known as
the great Munshi. His letters are studied in all Madrasahs, and are
perfect models. His influence on his age was immense. He led his
sovereign to a true appreciation of his duties, and from the moment
that he entered court the problem of successfully ruling over mixed
races was carefully considered, and the policy of toleration was the
result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great Emperor did not long survive his beloved and faithful
minister. Akbar died on November 10th, 1605, in his sixty-third year,
and was buried in the magnificent tomb at Sikundra, near Agra. There
his bones still rest, and his tomb is treated with all honour and
respect by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e603" href="#xd20e603"
name="xd20e603">xxx</a>]</span>the present rulers of the land. A new
cloth to cover the actual tomb was presented by the Earl of Northbrook,
after his visit to Sikundra in November 1873, when he was Viceroy of
India.</p>
<p>Akbar&rsquo;s wives were Sultana Rajmihal Begum, a daughter of his
uncle Hindal, by whom he had no children; Sultana Sulimah Begum, a
daughter of a daughter of Baber, who was a poetess; Nur Jahan; and the
Rajput Princess Jodh Bai, the mother of Salim.</p>
<p>His children were Hasan and Husain, who died in infancy; Salim, his
successor; Murad and Danyal, who died of drink in the lifetime of their
father, and three daughters.</p>
<p>Akbar is described by his son Salim as a very tall man, with the
strength of a lion, which was indicated by the great breadth of his
chest. His complexion was rather fair (<i>color de trigo</i> is the
description of a Spanish missionary who knew him), his eyes and
eyebrows dark, his countenance handsome. His beard was close-shaved.
His bearing was majestic, and &ldquo;the qualities of his mind seemed
to raise him above the denizens of this lower world.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e615src" href="#xd20e615" name="xd20e615src">21</a>
The Emperor Akbar combined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e620"
href="#xd20e620" name="xd20e620">xxxi</a>]</span>the thoughtful
philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, the toleration of Julian, the enterprise

of a Monro or a Thomason. We might search through the dynasties of the
East and West for many centuries back, and fail to discover so grand
and noble a character as that of Akbar. No sovereign has come nearer to
the ideal of a father of his people.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e622src"

<p>Akbar was the contemporary of Queen Elizabeth. He began to reign two
years before her, and outlived her for two years, but he was nine years
younger than the great Queen. He was succeeded by his son Salim, under
the name of <span class="corr" id="xd20e627" title=

<p>The native sources whence the story of Akbar&rsquo;s glorious reign
are derived, have already been indicated. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

considerable extent they are accessible in an English form. The
translation of the &ldquo;Ain-i Akbari,&rdquo; by Gladwin, was
published in 1800, and that of the historian Ferishta, by General
Briggs, in 1829. Elphinstone gives a brief account of Akbar&rsquo;s
reign in his history of India. In 1873 Blochmann&rsquo;s admirable
translation of the two first books of the &ldquo;Ain-i Akbari&rdquo;
was printed at Calcutta, for the Asiatic Society of Bengal. The work
also contains many extracts from El Badauni and the
&ldquo;Akbar-namah,&rdquo; and a perfect mine of accurate and well
arranged information from other sources.</p>
<p>In Volumes V. and VI. of the great work edited by Professor
Dowson,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e636src" href="#xd20e636" name=

&ldquo;Akbar-namah,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Tarikh-i Badauni,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Tarikh-i Alfi,&rdquo; the work of Shaikh Nurul Hakk, and that of

little book on the revenue <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e639"

<p>The slight notices of Akbar by contemporary or nearly contemporary
Europeans are derived from reports of the Jesuit missionaries, from
those of the Dutch at Surat, and from Hakluyt&rsquo;s Voyages. As early
as 1578 the Emperor had received a Christian missionary named Antonio
Cabral, at Fathp&uacute;r Sikri, had heard him argue with the Mullas,
and had been induced to write to Goa, requesting that two members of
the Society of Jesus might be sent to him with Christian books. In 1579
Rudolf Aquaviva<a class="noteref" id="xd20e646src" href="#xd20e646"
name="xd20e646src">25</a> and Antonio Monserrat were accordingly
despatched, with Francisco Henriquez as interpreter. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e649" href="#xd20e649" name=
"xd20e649">xxxiv</a>]</span>were well received, and again in 1591 three
brethren visited Akbar&rsquo;s court at Lahore. Finally a detachment of
missionaries was sent to Lahore, at Akbar&rsquo;s request, in 1594,
consisting of Geronimo Xavier (a nephew of St. Francis), Emanuel
Pineiro, a Portuguese, mentioned by Captain Hawkins,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e651src" href="#xd20e651" name="xd20e651src">26</a> and Benedek
Goes,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e657src" href="#xd20e657" name=
"xd20e657src">27</a> the famous traveller, who went with Akbar on his
summer trip to Kashmir. Xavier and Goes also accompanied the Emperor in
his Dakhin campaign; and when Goes set out on his perilous overland
journey to China, that liberal monarch praised his zeal and contributed
to his expenses. This was in 1602. Xavier celebrated Christmas with
great solemnity at Lahore, and wrote a life of Christ in Persian, which
Akbar read with much interest. Accounts of the visits of these
missionaries to Akbar&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e663"
href="#xd20e663" name="xd20e663">xxxv</a>]</span>court, and of their
journeys, are to be found in the Jesuit Histories.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e666src" href="#xd20e666" name="xd20e666src">28</a></p>
<p>But the most valuable European account of the reign of Akbar was
written by Pieter van den Broek, the chief of the Dutch factory at
Surat in 1620. It was published, in Latin, by Johan de Laet, and forms
the tenth chapter of his &ldquo;<span lang="la">De Imperio Magni
Mogolis</span>&rdquo; (Leyden, 1631). De Laet calls it &ldquo;a
fragment of Indian history which we have received from some of our
countrymen, and translated from Dutch into Latin.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>Ralph Fitch is the only English traveller who has written an account
of a visit to the court of Akbar.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e697src"
href="#xd20e697" name="xd20e697src">31</a> Accompanied by Mr. John
Newbery, a jeweller named William Leedes, and James Story, a painter,
he reached the court at Agra with a letter of introduction from Queen
Elizabeth, in the year 1585. Thence Newbery started to return overland.
Leedes entered the service of Akbar, settling at Fathp&uacute;r; and
Fitch went on to Bengal, eventually returning home.</p>
<p>Ab&uacute;-l Fazl tells us, casually, that, through the negligence
of the local officers, some of the cities and marts of Gujrat were
frequented by Europeans. Two centuries and a half after his
master&rsquo;s death, these intruders held undisputed sovereignty not
only over the whole of Akbar&rsquo;s empire, but over all India, a vast
dominion which had never before been united under one rule. They
approached from the sea, the base of their operations is their ships,
and not, as in the case of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e702"
href="#xd20e702" name="xd20e702">xxxvii</a>]</span>Akbar&rsquo;s
grandsire, the mountains of the north-west frontier.</p>
<p>If the balance of administrative merit is in favour of the English,
and this is not established, it in no way detracts from the glory of
the great Emperor. Yet we may claim that the islanders who now occupy
the place of Akbar are not unworthy to succeed him. The work that is
before us is more prosaic than was the duty of the puissant sovereign.
The charm of one central glory, round which all that was great and good
in India could congregate; the fascination of one ruling spirit,
combining irresistible power with virtue and <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e706" title="Source: benificence">beneficence</span>; the pomp and
circumstance of a brilliant court&mdash;all these are gone for ever. We
have instead the united thought and energy of many sound heads and
brave hearts, working without ostentation, and achieving objects of a
magnitude and endurance such as no single brain of any despot, how
great soever, could even conceive.</p>

included in the empire of Akbar; nor was a great part of Bombay
(probably about half) under Akbar&rsquo;s revenue system. In Bombay
land revenue (including Sind) in 1877 was &pound;3,344,664; and half
this sum &pound;1,672,332. For a rough comparison these three sums
(namely the amount of land revenue from Madras, Burma, and half Bombay)
must be deducted from the land revenue of 1877, and &pound;807,102 (the
revenue of Kabul) from the land revenue of Akbar. This leaves

was born at Liege in 1832, and was a Doctor of Law, residing chiefly at

an appointment in the office of the Royal Archives, and was for a short
time a member of the States General for the district of Trenthe.</p>
<p>With reference to his eastern studies, we find them bearing fruit in
the periodical literature of Holland during the last ten years of his

endowed with a rich and fertile imagination, and with great powers of
expression. In his romance of Akbar, his most carefully drawn
character, and that on which he seems to have bestowed most thought, is
the Hindu girl Iravati. In her he endeavoured to portray his conception
of the class of devoted loving women of whom Damayanti is the type; and
Siddha Rama is evidently intended to be the Nala of a later age. But he
has bestowed equal care on his treatment of the more difficult part of
his subject, and has brought considerable ability and much study and
research to the task of presenting to his readers a vivid and at the
same time a life-like picture of that remarkable prince round whom the
action of the story centres, and of the two brothers who were his
devoted friends.</p>

will mainly rest. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e753" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The grand figure of the Emperor Akbar, the ruler of
India during the last half of the sixteenth century (1556&ndash;1605),
for many reasons appeared to me to be of such importance that I could
not resist the temptation of making him the chief person in a romantic
sketch which I now venture to offer to public notice.</p>
<p>Some readers may desire to be able to distinguish accurately between
what is, and what is not historical. For their benefit I give the
following explanation. To real history, besides Akbar himself, belong
his son Salim, the Wazir Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, and his brother Faizi,
Abdul Kadir Badaoni, Rudolf Aquaviva the Jesuit, and a few others of
less note. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e772" href="#xd20e772"
name="xd20e772">xliv</a>]</span>Parviz belongs to history, but he bore
another name. Nandigupta is not a historical personage, but rather the
type of a character often met with in the history of India, and
especially of Kashmir. Gorakh and his Thugs are also types. Iravati was
not a real person, but the image of a Hindu woman as she is often met
with in the ancient dramas and legends of India. Many of the sayings
and speeches placed in the mouths of the characters in the romance are
historical. For reasons which may be easily understood, the events in
the narrative are made to deviate slightly from historical truth. In
the days of Akbar, for instance, Kashmir was no longer ruled by Hindu
Princes, although the people were entirely Indian. Again; the attempt
of Salim, concerning which many particulars are given, was not made
during an expedition against Kashmir, but against the Dakhin. Faizi was
older than Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, and died before his brother&rsquo;s
murder. Fathp&uacute;r lies at a greater distance from Agra than would
appear in the following pages. In the characters and acts of the people
there are also some slight and unimportant deviations from historical
fact.</p>
<p>The attempt has been made to follow the oriental forms, especially
in the conversations, so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e776" href=
"#xd20e776" name="xd20e776">xlv</a>]</span>far as was possible without
slavish imitation. The poems, which are here and there woven into the
narrative, have been translated by me from the originals.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to give here an exact list of the sources
which have aided in the composition of this work; nor is there much to
impart, on this subject, that would be new to the historian. He knows
well that the principal authorities for the life of Akbar, for his
institutions and ideas, are the writings of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl and Abdul
Kadir, whence eastern as well as western writers have drawn their
information. The reports of the Jesuits of that period, though often
prejudiced, yet in many points supplement and illustrate the works of
native historians. It is also necessary to add that various modern
histories and books of travel have been used.</p>
<p>For what is purely Indian in this romance, Sanscrit literature, with
its many legends, dramas, and romances, has been made use of. For the
philosophical ideas of Akbar the best authority is his principal
opponent, Abdul Kadir. The Vedas, from which the Emperor borrowed many
of his ideas, have also been consulted.</p>
<p>One source of information merits special mention, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e784" href="#xd20e784" name=
"xd20e784">xlvi</a>]</span>as it is but little known. That is, the
reports on the country and people made by merchants of our East India
Company, who, shortly after Akbar&rsquo;s reign, were established at
Surat and Agra. Their letters are still preserved in our colonial
archives.</p>
<p>How accurate soever one may strive to be, yet in an attempt of this
kind there must always be the possibility of errors, especially in the
descriptions of places. If here and there mistakes have crept into the
text, the writer asks pardon in anticipation, and will be grateful for
any corrections.</p>

<p class="first">The last rays of the setting sun shot through the sky
in crimson light, and were reflected back by the snows of
Badari-natha<a class="noteref" id="xd20e995src" href="#xd20e995" name=
"xd20e995src">1</a> and the sharp peaks of the Him&aacute;laya, while a
soft south wind wafted to the mountain tops the perfume of trees and
flowers which all day had hung over the valleys. For centuries and
centuries had the rays of the same sun lit up the same heights, and the
perfume of flowers had risen to the mountains, with no change and no
disturbance; while far in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href=
"#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>distance men fought and struggled,
mighty kingdoms rose and fell, and thoughtful minds vainly sought the
aim and reason of the existence of the universe.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century of our era, when
Jelalu-d&iacute;n-Muhammad, surnamed Akbar the Great, had raised the
empire of the Moghuls to the highest point of power and glory, the
lofty Him&aacute;laya, once the scarcely accessible abode of the
Devas,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1002src" href="#xd20e1002" name=
"xd20e1002src">2</a> still remained wild and inhospitable. These
solitudes were scarcely ever trodden by human foot, and seldom even did
the cry of some passing bird of prey, or the hum of dancing insects,
break the intense and almost audible silence.</p>
<p>Still the place was not so entirely deserted as a careless observer
might imagine. Nearly hidden in the long grass a tiger lay stretched
out, his coat flecked with black, dreaming in philosophical rest,
sometimes gazing upwards at the snow-crowned peaks, and then half
closing his eyes before the still vivid light. He looked down on the
lovely green valleys far below, stretching away until they met other
mountains rising into the clear sky, losing themselves and seeming to
melt and blend into the brilliant colours of the horizon. Of what did
he think? sometimes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span>gazing upwards, sometimes looking down into the
depths below, perhaps in misty remembrance of the times when, in
another form, he reigned&mdash;a mighty rajah over luxurious Kashmir,
with vassals bowing before him and lovely women vieing with one another
for the honour of his notice. Or was, indeed, the royal beast nothing
more than a gigantic cat? a monster of the jungle? and not the lost
soul of some former proud and haughty ruler. He was now, in truth, the
king of the wilderness, where no rival dared to challenge his rights.
That he well knew his power, could be seen in the proud glance he cast
around him. But, suddenly waking from these day-dreams, he sprang to
his feet and listened. A noise, the sound of men&rsquo;s voices, had
fallen on his quick ear.</p>
<p>Though still at some little distance, a group of riders was
descending by the only accessible path in the mountains towards the
valley. A young and handsome man, whose proud carriage and rich
clothing showed that he was of noble birth, accompanied by another,
older in years and more gravely clad, and followed by two servants,
formed the party. The youth was mounted on a white Arab, small but
powerfully built, and of great speed. The older man rode a larger horse
of dark colour, while the servants bestrode rough but strong mountain
ponies. The youth wore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4"
name="pb4">4</a>]</span>a blue silk jacket ornamented with golden
buttons, wide trousers and red shoes, and a light cap with a long
feather fastened by a diamond. A short sabre hung at his side, and a
jewelled dagger was stuck into his richly ornamented girdle. In his
right hand he held a long spear. He was tall and well formed, and his
complexion was fair, being scarcely tanned by the sun&rsquo;s rays. His
eyes and hair were dark, and a brown moustache betokened,
unmistakeably, that he sprang from the Aryan race. His companion was a
powerful, broad-shouldered man of dark complexion, yet showing by his
finely cut features that Aryan blood also flowed through his veins. A
thick curling beard nearly hid his face, which was shaded by a white
turban. His person was enveloped in a long robe of dark but fine
material, which reached nearly to his feet, and was secured round his
waist by a golden belt. He, also, was armed with sabre and spear, and
from his shoulder hung a small round shield. The only clothing of the
servants was a cloak thrown round their dusky limbs, and many bright
copper rings on their wrists and ancles clanked against each other as
they rode along. Short spears and small shields were their only
weapons.</p>
<p>It was easy to discover from their conversation who these travellers
were, whence they came, and the reason of their journey. The young
nobleman, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>Siddha<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1019src" href=
"#xd20e1019" name="xd20e1019src">3</a> Rama<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1030src" href="#xd20e1030" name="xd20e1030src">4</a>, was the son
of the First Minister of Kashmir, entrusted by his father with
important letters to the court of the Emperor Akbar at Agra, where he
was to take command of a division of Rajput cavalry belonging to the
imperial army. He was accompanied by Kulluka,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1035src" href="#xd20e1035" name="xd20e1035src">5</a> his tutor, a
Brahman of high descent, a man of learning and a warrior, one who knew
as well how to instruct his pupil in the arts of war and martial
exercises, as in the sacred language with its classic and holy
writings.</p>
<p>But before reaching Agra they had to visit a hermit in the
mountains, and then to make their way to Allahabad, where
Siddha&rsquo;s uncle, in the Emperor&rsquo;s name, commanded the fort
at the junction of the Ganges and Jamuna. There too was Iravati, his
daughter, and the betrothed of Siddha, counting the days to their
coming and the meeting with her future husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, honoured Kulluka,&rdquo; said Siddha, after having
ridden for a time silently by the side of his tutor, &ldquo;you, who
know the way, tell me that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href=
"#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>we are close to the abode of
Gurupada.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1044src" href="#xd20e1044" name=
"xd20e1044src">6</a> It may be so, but I can see nothing that is at all
like a cell. Is it possible that the holy man has departed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little more patience,&rdquo; answered the Brahman,
&ldquo;and we shall soon come to the turning, whence you will see the
little wood in the valley where Gurupada has built his solitary
dwelling. But it seems to me you might speak with more respect of one
so venerable. You will, however, learn that when you meet
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intended no harm and no disrespect,&rdquo; rejoined Siddha.
&ldquo;But what is that?&rdquo; cried he, suddenly pointing with his
spear towards the tall grass on the mountain side, which was waving
gently, though unstirred by the wind.</p>
<p>Before his calmer companion could restrain him, the impatient hunter
had turned his horse into the long grass, and was hurrying towards the
spot where the movement had been seen. But before either Kulluka or the
servants could hasten after him, they saw him draw rein and remain
motionless, gazing before him.</p>
<p>All movement in the grass had ceased, not one blade stirred, and not
a sound was to be heard. Then again the grass moved and bent, but much
farther off, betraying the presence of a large glossy tiger bounding
away.</p>
<p>Siddha put spurs to his horse, and the next <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>moment lay
full length on the ground. A hole, thickly covered with vegetation, had
thrown horse and rider. But both instantly recovered their footing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, Vatsa,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1067src" href="#xd20e1067" name="xd20e1067src">7</a> he said to
his servant, who had flung himself from his pony and hurried to his
master. &ldquo;I have fallen softly enough; nor, it is to be hoped, has
any harm come to my horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On examination they found that the noble grey was as uninjured as
his headlong rider; but no sign of the tiger was any longer
visible.</p>
<p>There was nothing left to be done but to spring into the saddle and
continue the interrupted journey.</p>
<p>Siddha rode silently by the side of his guru, not a little ashamed
of his foolish adventure, but the latter broke the silence by saying,
&ldquo;That was but a childish trick, dear lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Siddha, in a shamefaced tone, &ldquo;I
must have indeed appeared ridiculous, rolling over in such a
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Kulluka, &ldquo;that you could not
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can see concealed holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I mean is something quite different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you will soon learn, if what I suspect is the
case.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>The smile that played round Kulluka&rsquo;s mouth at these words
only increased Siddha&rsquo;s curiosity; but his questions were
interrupted by their reaching a turn in the road where, spread out
before them, bathed in golden sunshine, lay another part of the
valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See there,&rdquo; said Kulluka, pointing with his lance to a
thick clump of trees below them, near which, like a silver thread,
flowed a little stream; &ldquo;there lives Gurupada!&rdquo; And,
without more words, the riders descended a steep declivity, following a
path partly formed by nature and partly by the labour of men, that led
towards the plain.</p>
<p>Under the dense shade of trees stood a low building roofed with
reeds, and built with slight bamboos overgrown with creepers, more like
some resort of pleasure than the poor cell of a holy man passing his
life in penance. Behind was the dark jungle, in front an emerald lake,
reflecting back a hundred different tints, and bordered by blue and
white lotus flowers. The clear silver stream entered at one end and,
flowing out at the other side, continued its course to the lower
valleys just seen in the haze of the distance. Far away the ranges of
mountains rose like rocky giants to the heavens, their summits never
trodden by the foot of man.</p>
<p>For a moment our travellers remained still, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>lost in
admiration of a view at once so magnificent and so lovely. But quickly
remembering that they had reached the end of their journey, they
dismounted and entrusted the horses to their servants, while Kulluka
advanced to the dwelling, meaning to give notice of their arrival. But
he might have saved himself the trouble, for he had scarcely reached
the door when the hermit appeared in the threshold, followed by a
servant who, at a sign from his master, took charge of the
visitors&rsquo; horses.</p>
<p>Extraordinary was the impression which the sight of this recluse
made on Siddha. In his own country, among his mountains and forests, he
had seen penitents, self-denying holy men, wandering mendicants, in
numbers and of all kinds&mdash;some in foul and sordid rags, with long
bamboo staves in their hands and rosaries at their sides, some with a
cloth made of the bark of trees, others with no clothing, shaven, and
covered with ashes, their foreheads and breasts smeared with white
chalk: all supported by the strength of a boundless fanaticism. No
wonder that the young man, used to the most polished civilisation,
should have looked with the deepest contempt on such people; and in
spite of his respect for his tutor, who had always named the hermit of
Badrinath with veneration, he had expected but little from the man who
now stood ready <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>at his door to receive them. All the greater was
the impression now made upon him by the tall and stately figure
advancing to them, with dignity but at the same time with an air of
friendly welcome.</p>
<p>He was an old man, in a dazzling white garment, with a few fine
locks on the otherwise bald head, and a heavy silvery beard, but not in
the least bent by the weight of years. His friendly though proud
expression showed plainly that he had been accustomed to give, rather
than to receive and obey, commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome friends,&rdquo; he said, taking his two
visitors by the hand, who bent respectfully before him. &ldquo;Welcome
to my solitude. It is indeed a pleasure to hear again
of&rdquo;&mdash;here he seemed to hesitate, but proceeded in a firm
voice, &ldquo;of you and my country and people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before either Kulluka and Siddha could reply, their attention was
drawn to a low growl close to them, and in another instant, from behind
the building, a magnificent tiger appeared with slow and stately tread,
and drew near the three men, waving its heavy tail from side to side.
Instantly Siddha drew back a step, and laid his hand on the dagger in
his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that plaything in its place,&rdquo; said Gurupada,
laughing. &ldquo;Do not injure Hara.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1113src" href="#xd20e1113" name="xd20e1113src">8</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>Then,
turning to the tiger, he called him in a commanding tone, and instantly
the powerful animal laid himself down at his master&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you?&rdquo; said Kulluka to Siddha, pointing
to the tiger. &ldquo;Do you now understand why it was a foolish trick
you played?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, honoured lord, pardon!&rdquo; said Siddha, turning
with clasped hands to Gurupada, understanding that it was the tiger of
the hermit that he had given chase to. &ldquo;Indeed I did not
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; interrupted Gurupada, &ldquo;you have
been hunting Hara. That has happened before, but has not always ended
so well for the hunter as for my four-footed friend here. For he can
become angry, though he has never harmed those who leave him alone. I
have had him, as Kulluka knows, ever since he was a small cub, and we
are now well accustomed to each other. Is it not so, Hara?&rdquo; he
said, bending towards the tiger, that, half raising itself up, rubbed
its broad head against its master&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;And my
friends,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;are also his. See now!&rdquo; And
Siddha, drawing near, laid his hand gently on its shoulder, on which
the tiger, looking alternately at both, laid down at Siddha&rsquo;s
feet, and leant its head against his hand. This time the young man did
not step back, but stroked the animal&rsquo;s head; nor was he startled
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>when, yawning, it opened its mighty jaws, showing
rows of white sharp teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said Gurupada, as Hara returned to him.
&ldquo;I have seen many older than you who would not have remained so
calm. But now let us think of other things. Travellers, after so long a
journey through a wilderness where there is not much to be found, must
need refreshment. Follow me.&rdquo; And, going before them, the hermit
entered his dwelling.</p>
<p>The interior contained nothing beyond necessaries, but all in most
perfect order, and arranged with elegance.</p>
<p>After the guests had rested themselves with him, on fine mats spread
on the floor, the servant, who had taken charge of the horses, brought
in some dishes of food.</p>
<p>The simple and easy tone in which the otherwise dignified hermit
spoke, showed that he was a man of the world, and soon gave confidence
to the Minister&rsquo;s son. Siddha answered Gurupada&rsquo;s questions
respecting his father, his betrothed Iravati, and his life in Kashmir,
with frankness mingled with respect. To his astonishment the hermit
appeared to know all that had happened in earlier days in Kashmir, and
showed himself acquainted with circumstances that must have been a
secret to all excepting those who had access to the most private parts
of the royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>palace. Without doubt, in earlier years, Gurupada
must have been a trusted councillor of one of the princes. But Siddha
dared venture no indiscreet questions touching the hermit&rsquo;s
former rank. He remarked that Gurupada&rsquo;s conversation was
cheerful, and that he appeared perfectly content with his present
station. Yet at times, in talking over political events in the north, a
dark cloud momentarily crossed his noble countenance, as though the
strong will of the philosopher could not hinder a passing emotion from
being visible.</p>
<p>It had become late, and night was drawing on, the moon throwing her
silvery light over the landscape which was visible through the open
bamboos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Gurupada, rising, &ldquo;pardon me, noble
Siddha, if with your tutor and my friend I withdraw from the pleasure
of your company. I have much to say to him which for the present must
be a secret, and in which you probably would have but little interest.
If you wish to refresh yourself there is the lake, and to a bath in the
open air you are doubtless well accustomed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two elder men left the room together, and for long after Siddha
saw them arm-in-arm, walking up and down, deep in earnest converse.
When they returned it was time to go to rest, and the travellers were
well pleased to stretch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>their weary limbs on the
sleeping-places prepared for them.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, after a fresh bath and hearty breakfast, our
travellers were ready to continue their journey. While the horses were
being saddled, Gurupada drew Siddha on one side, out of hearing of
Kulluka, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy hermits, when young men visit them, are not accustomed
to let them depart without some instruction and advice. You expect,
perhaps, the same from me; but you are mistaken. I can add nothing to
what Kulluka, your wise and learned guru has doubtless already taught
you. The world you are going to seek, and life itself, must teach you
what remains. Still, one word, to which I will add a request. Do not
fear, when you enter the luxurious and magnificent court at Agra, to
take your part in all lawful diversions and amusements; and thus you
will learn to distinguish the real from the unreal. Think always of
what doubtless your tutor has often taught you, keep your conscience
pure, and take good care that no deed of yours shall ever give cause of
shame either to others or to yourself. But should it happen that, in
spite of your earnest striving to keep these precepts, the repose of
your conscience should be disturbed, and you wish for some friend to
whom you could open your heart, think then of an old friend of your
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>father and your tutor, and come to the Hermit of
Badrinath. Will you promise me this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise it,&rdquo; answered Siddha, simply, but with manly
earnestness, as he folded his arms respectfully on his breast. With
greater friendliness than before, Gurupada took him by both hands, and
pressed them heartily.</p>
<p>The horses were soon brought forward, and the riders, after taking
leave of the hermit, sprang into their saddles, and, followed by the
servants, took their way from the jungle to the mountain path.</p>
<p>More than once Siddha looked back, casting a glance to where the
figure of the wise man was still visible between the trunks of the tall
trees, standing at the threshold of his dwelling, with the tiger by his
side, and then rode silently by his companion, buried in thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as though waking from a day-dream, he drew in his horse
with such force as almost to throw it upon its haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kulluka,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I never saw such a man
as Gurupada.&rdquo; But at the same time he coloured to the ears,
thinking, but too late, that this exclamation might not be very
pleasing to his friend and teacher.</p>
<p>But he had needlessly alarmed himself. Kulluka&rsquo;s countenance
expressed unfeigned pleasure at the admiration of his pupil for his old
friend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it gives me great pleasure
that you should so think of him, and it speaks well for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Siddha said, after a moment of silence,
&ldquo;who then is Gurupada?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;that you have seen for
yourself&mdash;a hermit of the Him&aacute;laya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Siddha, impatiently, &ldquo;that I know
well; but what was he first, before he came here and tamed
tigers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He attempted to tame men,&rdquo; answered Kulluka, &ldquo;but
in that he did not always succeed. But why did you not ask him yourself
who he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that have been discreet,&mdash;should you have approved
of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, and you acted rightly in not violating the
rights of hospitality by indiscreet curiosity, even if it arose from
real interest and for that you deserve that your curiosity should be
set at rest. Gurupada gave me permission to recount his former life and
tell you his name. So listen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was once a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now,&rdquo; said Siddha, a little disturbed, &ldquo;are
you going to tell me a tale from Somadeva,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1185src" href="#xd20e1185" name="xd20e1185src">9</a> like those I
heard so often from you when I was a little boy?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen or not, as you will, to my tale,&rdquo; answered
Kulluka, calmly. &ldquo;He was, I say, once a king, who, supported by
good councillors, governed his kingdom with wisdom and prudence. He had
no children, only a younger brother, a young man of great ability, to
whom he was warmly attached, and whom he had chosen as his successor
when death should take him, or when the weight of affairs of state
should become too heavy for him to bear. But the brother was ambitious,
and, in spite of some good qualities, he had not patience to wait his
time. He allowed himself to be led away by parties in the state
inimical to the existing government. First he intrigued secretly, and
in the end he took up arms against his brother and lawful prince. But
he and his followers were defeated, and brought prisoners to the
capital. However, this did not put an end to the insurrection.
Disturbances still continued, and the only means that remained to the
king to suppress them was by the death of his ambitious and dangerous
brother, however dearly he loved him, and by subjecting his followers
to the same fate. But by so doing his throne <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>would be
founded on the blood of his brother and others; which might call
endless feuds into life, to which there could be no other end but the
utter exhaustion of the kingdom. Yet hardly anyone doubted that the
king would, in the end, have recourse to this now unavoidable measure.
Suddenly, a rumour spread that he had disappeared from the palace, and
in all probability, though not certainly, had fallen a victim to
treachery. Since that time he has never been heard of, and his brother,
released from prison, ascended the throne as the lawful heir, and has
reigned ever since, wisely retaining his brother&rsquo;s councillors at
his side. Though not ruling with equal wisdom, yet his reign has been
fortunate, and peace has been restored to his country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, for a moment, Kulluka broke off his tale to look at his
companion and pupil, but his countenance showed neither astonishment
nor special interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is simply the
history of our present king and his predecessor and elder brother
Nandigupta,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1202src" href="#xd20e1202" name=
"xd20e1202src">10</a> which is known to all, to me as well as to every
other Kashmiri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Kulluka, &ldquo;the history of
which I remind you is well known. What is not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>known to
every one, only to a few, is that King Nandigupta did not fall through
treachery, is not dead, nor was he driven away. Of his own accord, and
without the knowledge of his brother, nor of any but a few most trusty
friends, he took refuge in a distant retreat, where by spreading a
report that he had been slain, he saved his brother from a shameful
death and his country from probable destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Nandigupta still lives,&rdquo; cried Siddha,
&ldquo;and he is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you doubtless have already guessed,&rdquo; answered
Kulluka, &ldquo;the hermit we have just left; but you must hold his
secret sacred. The secret of his kingdom and his race is entrusted to
your honour. The son of his most faithful servant and friend should
know it, and will know well how to guard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked Siddha, half dissatisfied, &ldquo;did you
not tell me this while we were still there? I might then have thanked
the prince for all the benefits which, in the days of his greatness, my
father and all our race received at his hands. But, it is true, you had
no right to speak as long as he himself did not do so. But I still have
an opportunity; for Gurupada, if he will be so called, made me promise
to seek him if ever I should find myself in circumstances of difficulty
and need good advice.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have done well in giving your promise,&rdquo; said
Kulluka. &ldquo;Keep your word. Gurupada is better and wiser than any
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Siddha scarcely heard. He was again immersed in thought. The
meeting with the hermit, and the discovery of his secret, made a deep
impression on him: that in the beginning of his journey he should have
met with a princely philosopher, who, possessing almost unlimited
power, and living in luxury, had willingly sacrificed all for love of
his brother and his country; and who, happy in the consciousness of
having done well, showed himself cheerful and contented with his simple
life in the wilderness, with no other companions than a faithful
servant and a beast of prey. Now he was on his road to the court of the
fortunate and far-famed ruler of a great empire, who ruled his people
more by wisdom than by the power of the sword; who had at his disposal
enormous revenues; and who might call himself the ally of mighty
princes in most distant countries, and protector of all known religions
in the world.</p>
<p>The good Siddha, who had been accustomed to pride himself somewhat
on his nobility and consequence, suddenly felt how small he was in
comparison with two such men. It was indeed difficult to decide which
was the greater of the two, and he wisely determined to suspend his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>judgment until he should have seen the Emperor
Akbar himself.</p>
<p>This decision brought him back to the next goal of their journey, a
visit to Allahabad, where his dearly loved bride&mdash;the beautiful
Iravati&mdash;awaited his coming. His countenance, which for some
minutes had been grave and earnest, brightened up, and striking spurs
into his horse, as a long flat piece of country stretched out before
them, he cried, joyfully, &ldquo;Come, now for a gallop!&rdquo; and
darting forward, Kulluka saw brandishing his light spear, and shouting
the name that carried off the victory in his
thoughts&mdash;&ldquo;Iravati!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward! forward, then!&rdquo; muttered the Brahman to
himself, setting his horse to a gallop, &ldquo;until the end is
reached; for me it is almost done, but for him the journey of life is
only beginning. Oh that he may always find it smooth as this! but he
also must meet with rocks and slippery precipices, and perhaps
also&mdash;abysses. But may they only,&rdquo; he added, smiling to
himself, as he thought of the adventure of the preceding evening,
&ldquo;be harmless precipices.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="label">Chapter II.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Iravati.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A young girl was seated on a balcony, all overgrown
with trees and plants, in the great castle of Allahabad&mdash;palace
and fortress in one. Her head rested on her hand as, musing, she gazed
on the landscape stretched out before her on both sides of the two
rivers that met here, and were now glittering in the light of an
unclouded morning sun. To the left the rocky heights and sandy shores
of the Jamuna; to the right the valley of the Granges; everywhere thick
masses of mango-trees, in which numberless parrots and other
bright-plumaged birds made their homes. Here and there small islands
raised themselves above the surface of the water, and in the background
there were rocky hills crowned with pagodas. Judging only by her dress,
it would not have been supposed that the girl, sunk in a day-dream,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>was of exalted rank. She wore a simple white robe,
with a narrow border of dark red, clasped by a golden girdle; a golden
band held back her thick black locks, in which a single flower formed
her only ornament, and that was all. But what need had the slight
graceful figure, the fine-cut face, with its great dark eyes shaded by
long silken lashes, for other ornament than that given by nature, and
by Rama the god of love? And assuredly no offshoot of degenerate stem,
no daughter of low degree, could have arrayed herself with so much
elegance, and at the same time with such simplicity.</p>
<p>But the longing eyes did not, as of yore, rest with delight on the
magnificent scene around. To-day, as yesterday and many days before,
she gazed on the far-off mountains, in the direction from which the
long-expected one must come; but long had she watched in vain. Where
did he tarry? What could keep him? And did he think of her, or was it
only occasionally that his thoughts wandered to her, who for days and
months had devoted every thought to him and to him alone?</p>
<p>Then a heavy step was heard behind, in the room which opened on the
verandah, and, preceded by a servant who flung back the curtain hanging
before the door, a short, thick-set man of middle age approached, in a
close-fitting garment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"
name="pb24">24</a>]</span>that came down to his feet. A short sword
with a richly ornamented hilt, stuck in his belt, was the only token of
his rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble lady,&rdquo; said the servant, respectfully waking his
mistress from her day-dream, &ldquo;Salhana the governor, your father,
comes to visit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is welcome,&rdquo; answered the girl, accustomed from
infancy to be addressed with respect; and rising, she advanced to meet
her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iravati,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1259src" href=
"#xd20e1259" name="xd20e1259src">1</a> said he, looking at her with his
black, penetrating eyes, which gave the only expression to his pale
countenance, &ldquo;some time ago I told you that I expected Siddha
Rama, from Kashmir, your cousin and betrothed, with Kulluka his tutor.
They have just arrived, and are now in the neighbouring gallery. We
will go there to receive them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these tidings, for one moment Iravati seemed to forget
all the calm reserve to which she had schooled herself, and would have
hurried past her father to welcome him whom she had so long waited for;
but Salhana delayed her by a slight motion of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First one word,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is known to me that
the professors of Islam, under whom we live, disapprove most highly of
free intercourse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>between unmarried youths and young girls, and that
many of our Hindus have adapted themselves to the opinions of our
governors; but for my part, as you know, I am a follower of our old
customs, however much I wish to see observed all fitting forms, and so
I give you permission, as in early days in our own country, freely to
speak with your cousin and bridegroom, but only allow our most trusted
friends to know it, otherwise my influence here, where I govern, and
your good name, may suffer. Now come.&rdquo; And going before her, he
led the way to the open verandah looking down on the river, where their
two visitors stood awaiting their appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome, my lords and friends,&rdquo; said Salhana,
with dignity; &ldquo;and I thank you for granting my request, and
coming straight to my dwelling, instead of taking up your abode in the
town, as many do.&rdquo; These words sounded cordial, though the tone
in which they were pronounced was as expressionless as his stiff
countenance.</p>
<p>Some might have remarked this, but not Siddha, who, barely greeting
his stately uncle or giving Kulluka time to receive the reverent
greeting of Iravati, flung himself on his knees before her, and pressed
a burning kiss on the hand she held out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; she said, signing to him to rise, (and how
sweet sounded that gentle voice!) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>&ldquo;welcome, friend. How long
we have watched for your approach, looking towards yonder mountains,
and almost doubting if you would ever come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not believe, beloved,&rdquo; cried Siddha, almost
indignantly, &ldquo;that I would have delayed my arrival in Allahabad
for one moment longer than was necessary. If I could have leapt over
rivers and mountains to have been sooner with you, and had my horse had
more wings than Vishnu&rsquo;s Garuda,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1279src" href="#xd20e1279" name="xd20e1279src">2</a> I should
not, indeed, have spared him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you willingly,&rdquo; said Iravati, with a friendly
smile, &ldquo;and indeed I meant no reproach to you or to our trusty
friend Kulluka, and we must rejoice all the more at being together, as
I hear from my father that it is only for a very short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Salhana, after a few words with Kulluka,
interrupting the conversation of the two lovers, &ldquo;our friends
must leave us early to-morrow; but I did not expect otherwise. Yet,
noble Siddha, I must shorten by a few minutes your interview with your
bride, as I wish to speak a few words with you, and at once, for my
time is precious, and before our mid-day meal I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>have
many things to do. Will it please you to follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This request was not to be refused, and unwillingly and with many a
longing look towards Iravati, Siddha followed his courteous but
imperious uncle to the garden on the other side of the palace. There,
under the thick shade of trees, Salhana seated himself on a carpet,
signing to his nephew to take a place by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you are going,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;to seek your
fortune in the immediate service of the great Emperor. In truth you may
hold yourself fortunate that you have a father who knows how to give
you so favourable an opportunity, and also, if I may add it without
presumption, an uncle who, by the accident of his position, may be able
to afford you help in case of need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that I am very grateful,&rdquo; answered Siddha,
&ldquo;and I hope never to forget that you, perhaps more than my
father, have aided to make easy to me the first step on the ladder, not
only because it may be that I shall have opportunities of
distinguishing myself, but that I shall be able to achieve more here
than in our own beautiful but far-away country; and at the same time I
shall see the Emperor living in all the splendour of his court, of
which I have heard so much at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Salhana, &ldquo;but a word of counsel;
beware of exaggerated expectations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28"
href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>not as regards the magnificence
of palaces and courts, of which in the north we can hardly form an
idea, but of the Emperor himself; it is better to begin without highly
wrought expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; asked Siddha, in astonishment; &ldquo;in truth
does not Akbar deserve his name? is he not, as my father and my tutor
have always represented him, a great man as well as a mighty
prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I did not say,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;but our
great men can have their faults, which may threaten to become dangerous
for others. Listen,&rdquo; continued the governor, looking round to see
there was no one within earshot, and sinking his voice to a whisper:
&ldquo;whenever a man attains such power as Akbar, through his own
courage and prudence, then is the longing to attain more not easily
satisfied. The Emperor, who has subdued states and people to his rule,
can hardly bear that your and my fatherland should remain so entirely
independent. You know, moreover, do you not, how every now and then,
although it was kept secret from most, divisions have broken out in
Kashmir between our king and his two sons, in the same way as in
earlier days between him and his brother Nandigupta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not know it,&rdquo; said Siddha; &ldquo;this is the
first time it has come to my ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;you should inquire
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>about it when the opportunity offers. I can tell
you somewhat of it at once, but do not speak of it to Kulluka; for
that, I think, might not be well. The divisions between the king and
his two sons were stirred up&mdash;you understand by whom. If open
feuds once broke out, and the country was divided into parties, then a
pretence for declaring war on us would easily be found, and the Emperor
would invade our country with a strong army, guided through the
mountain passes by his spies, and so our country would be incorporated
in his empire. This does not prevent my acknowledging with admiration
his wonderful conquests, but the same ambition which has made his
people great may be the cause of the destruction of our
independence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how,&rdquo; asked Siddha, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought,&mdash;&ldquo;if this is so, how can you remain the servant of
a man who has sworn the destruction of our country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; said Salhana, in his turn surprised.
&ldquo;Is it not well that one of us, without harming the Emperor, but,
on the contrary, serving him in many important affairs, should keep an
eye on his plans and actions. It is well that you yourself, under my
recommendation and protection, should come still more closely in
contact with our ruler. Certainly you will be less suspicious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>than I, but still in this respect you can be of
great service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Siddha, doubtfully, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought, &ldquo;is that honourable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; answered Salhana, in a dignified
tone,<a id="xd20e1319" name="xd20e1319"></a> although his countenance
expressed no anger, &ldquo;let me remark to you that a man of my age
and experience should know well what is honourable and what is not; and
you, only just commencing your part in life, should not attempt to give
counsel on such a subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, uncle,&rdquo; answered Siddha, &ldquo;you know
that I am still so little acquainted with the principles of state
affairs, that I cannot understand them at once; and, also, Kulluka, my
guru,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1323src" href="#xd20e1323" name=
"xd20e1323src">3</a> has always impressed on me to follow the right
path, and never to act ambiguously towards anyone,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kulluka, my best friend,&rdquo; interrupted the other,
&ldquo;is an excellent man, for whom I have the greatest respect; but
he is a man of learning, not of facts; a man of theory, not of what is
practical. See, now, your country and people, who are dear to you, are
threatened by a prince whom you look upon with admiration, and would
willingly serve in all but that one thing. You <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>should
hold it as a duty to work against him in this, as far as possible. The
opportunity is now opened to you, not entirely, but in a certain
measure. Should you now spurn this opportunity, because of an
exaggerated idea of political honour? And does he himself act with
honour in accepting your services and mine while at the same time he
has designs on our king and country? and if not, what claim has he on
such special loyalty on our side? Moreover, go, if you will, to Akbar,
and say to his face, if you dare, that you see through his plans and
will oppose them; and before the day is over, my good friend, you will
be fettered in a dungeon, or on your way banished to the furthest
bounds of the Dakhin or Bengal, if worse does not befall you. Such
opposition would be of no service to us; far otherwise would it be to
make good use of favourable opportunities. By doing so, there would be
no harm done to the prince, while, on the other hand, we may perchance
save our fatherland from destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not convinced, but still not knowing how to refute such reasoning,
Siddha vainly sought for an answer, and remained silent, waiting for
what his uncle might have further to say. But he appeared to consider
the interview at an end, and made a movement to rise, when, in the path
leading to the place where they were seated, a figure appeared, just
such a one as would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32"
name="pb32">32</a>]</span>attract Siddha&rsquo;s attention and draw his
thoughts from the preceding conversation. He was tall, brown, and
closely shaven all but a single long lock of hair; his right arm and
breast were naked excepting for the sacred cord of the Brahmans; a
narrow white garment was thrown round his emaciated limbs. His sunken
dull eyes and hollow cheeks spoke of long fasts and severe penances.
Although not easily alarmed by man or beast, and accustomed to strange
appearances, yet for a moment Siddha started back. Many a tiger had he
slain in the jungle, and without fear killed many a deadly snake, yet
he could not overcome a feeling of horror at this sudden
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorakh<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1336src" href="#xd20e1336"
name="xd20e1336src">4</a> the Yogi,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1344src" href="#xd20e1344" name="xd20e1344src">5</a> explained
Salhana, &ldquo;priest of the Durga<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1352src"
href="#xd20e1352" name="xd20e1352src">6</a> temple, yonder on the
hills. Meet him with respect; he deserves it, and has more to impart to
you than you suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gliding rather than walking, the priest approached the two men who
had stood up to receive him, and, raising his clasped hands to his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>forehead, he said, in a slow, drawling voice,
&ldquo;Om, Om!<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1364src" href="#xd20e1364"
name="xd20e1364src">7</a> You, the favoured of the Lord of the World,
and of Durga his glorious consort. Om!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I greet you well, most honoured Gorakh,&rdquo; answered
Salhana to this curious salutation; &ldquo;you see here my nephew
Siddha Rama, from Kashmir, of whom I have already spoken to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is welcome,&rdquo; was Gorakh&rsquo;s reply; &ldquo;and
may he, above the strife of disunion, know how to lay the foundation
that leads to the endless blessings of union, wherein you, my friend,
begin more and more to recognise the true part of salvation.
Yet,&rdquo; continued he, after a moment of dignified silence,
&ldquo;the experience of life must teach him the way, as it has done
for you and me. We must allow the time needed for the scholar. In
truth, I know him, and know that he will belong to us.&rdquo; And here
he turned to Siddha: &ldquo;It is but lately that I met you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, honoured lord,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;that I
cannot recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;for at that
moment I was invisible to human eye.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>Too well acquainted with the extraordinary claims to the power of
rendering themselves invisible asserted by the Yogis, Siddha contented
himself with listening in silence to the priest, who, to his
astonishment, continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on that evening when you gave chase to the
hermit&rsquo;s tiger;&mdash;but we will speak to each other later. Now
the noble Salhana wishes to converse with me, so for the present
farewell, and may Durga&rsquo;s mighty consort bless you.&rdquo; And
murmuring in a low tone his &ldquo;Om, Om!&rdquo; the priest of Durga
and Salhana left him in the garden, his uncle crying to him, &ldquo;We
shall meet again soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last communication of the Yogi was well calculated to excite
Siddha&rsquo;s astonishment. How could the man know what had happened
to him yonder in the mountains, where, excepting his own companion, he
had seen no human being? But here the sight of his servant at a little
distance, wandering through the trees, brought to his mind the way by
which the riddle might be unravelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vatsa,&rdquo; said he, beckoning to the man, &ldquo;have
either you or Kulluka&rsquo;s servant just spoken with a
priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; answered Vatsa, &ldquo;we have not even
seen one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Siddha, now really astonished. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>&ldquo;Good; you can go.&rdquo; And turning away,
he murmured to himself, half disturbed and half alarmed, &ldquo;I will
speak to Kulluka about this.&rdquo; But how could a priest or anyone
else occupy his thoughts when, having gone but a little way, he caught
sight of the white robe and slight figure of Iravati, seated under the
thick shade of a mango, close to a pool of lotuses, while the air was
filled with the sweet music of a sparkling fountain, and cooled by its
falling waters. Flowers lay scattered around, and in her hand was a
half-finished wreath. Hearing footsteps approaching, and catching sight
of Siddha, she flung the wreath away, and hastened to meet her lover,
raising her clasped hands to her forehead. Siddha seized them in his
own, and, leading her back, flung himself on the moss at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a cruel man your father is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
part us so soon, when we had scarcely exchanged two words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Iravati, &ldquo;you must thank him for
allowing us to talk together, since it is long since this was allowed
to those who are betrothed to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my heart I will be grateful to him,&rdquo; said Siddha,
&ldquo;and more highly prize the happy moments spent with you. But you
do not seem quite to share in my joy; tell me the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Iravati; &ldquo;how can our meeting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>be unclouded happiness, when we are to part again
so soon? Perhaps, and even probably, these are the only short moments
in which, for a long time, we shall speak freely one to another; and
to-morrow you depart for the luxurious, turbulent city, where a simple
girl like me may easily be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten!&rdquo; cried Siddha; &ldquo;have I deserved such
suspicion from you? and what is the absence of a few months! Returns
not&rdquo;&mdash;asked he, in the words of Amaru, as, taking her hand
in his, he drew her nearer to him&mdash;&ldquo;Returns not he who
departs? Why, then, beloved, art thou sad? Do not my heart and word
remain yours, even though we part?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1407src" href="#xd20e1407" name="xd20e1407src">8</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; answered Iravati, &ldquo;if poets could comfort
us! But tell me, Siddha, have you never made any verses on
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that I could,&rdquo; was the modest reply; &ldquo;and
indeed I have tried, but what I wrote was never worthy of you. Still,
there is another art in which I am more accomplished than in poetry,
and my attempt in that line you shall see.&rdquo; And drawing from his
girdle a small locket, set with jewels, he showed a miniature, in which
she recognised her own image. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Siddha!&rdquo; she exclaimed, joyfully; &ldquo;but I am not
so beautiful as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so beautiful!&rdquo; repeated he. &ldquo;No; but a
hundred times more beautiful than my pencil or that of any other could
represent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was right, for according to Indian taste he had exaggerated
the eyes and mouth, when their regularity was one of the beauties of
Iravati&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said he, as she suddenly drew herself up and
quickly escaped from his arms, &ldquo;why are you now going to leave
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;in an instant I
will be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the swiftness of a gazelle he saw her taking her way through
the trees to the palace, ascending the broad marble steps as though she
scarcely touched them, and in a few moments return, holding in her hand
an object which, in the distance, he could not distinguish, but as she
drew nearer, and, with a blush, held it out to him, with an exclamation
of admiration, he recognised his own portrait. But this, in truth, was
an idealized likeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest!&rdquo; he said, in ecstasy; and before she could
draw back he had thrown his arms round her, and pressed a burning kiss
on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said she, gently disengaging herself; &ldquo;my
father should be well pleased with us, for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>we have
done just like the princes and princesses in our old national legends,
and have drawn each other&rsquo;s portraits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly so,&rdquo; added Siddha, &ldquo;for they drew
their own likenesses, and then exchanged with one another. But I think
our way is much the best; theirs appears to me extravagant vanity, in
our way of looking at it, or utterly aimless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; said Iravati, reproachfully; &ldquo;do you make
such remarks on the writings of the ancients? Who knows if you will not
next criticise our holy books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;if they here or there
make mistakes, or show a want of taste, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not, I hope, an unbeliever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unbeliever in what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the law of the Holy Veda, for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, dear one,&rdquo; interrupted Siddha, laughing,
&ldquo;do not let us employ the few moments allowed us as many of our
countrymen do, who can hardly meet each other without at once
discussing theological and philosophical questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and I know of a
game that is far prettier, and one that you also know.&rdquo; And
bending over the brink of the tank, she gathered a dark-blue lotus, and
picking up a long leaf that lay on the ground, and weaving <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>it into
a kind of boat, she placed the lotus in it and let it float on the
surface of the water, which was gently stirred by the falling fountain.
&ldquo;The lotus is my Siddha,&rdquo; said she, half to herself;
&ldquo;let us see if he will remain faithful to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Siddha, in his turn reproachfully,
&ldquo;that is a foolish game, and one that you should not
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iravati hardly listened to him, but watched with breathless
attention the waving leaf that was dancing on the rippling water.
&ldquo;Faithful, faithful!&rdquo; she cried; but then a sigh from the
south wind caught the frail vessel. It turned over and floated bottom
upwards, while the lotus disappeared. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried
Iravati, as she let her head sink in her breast; &ldquo;my forebodings,
then, have not deceived me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie! I say now in my turn,&rdquo; said Siddha; &ldquo;a
noble, well educated lady to hold to such follies, that are only to be
excused in ignorant peasant girls. And so you place more faith in the
leaf of a tree than in the word of honour of a nobleman who has pledged
you his troth, as you have to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Siddha,&rdquo; sighed Iravati, &ldquo;you must forgive me
if I do seem rather childish; and does not my uneasiness show you how
much I love you? However great my faith in your word is, I cannot help
thinking with anxiety of the city to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>which you go; and who
knows what temptation awaits you there? But I confess that I was wrong,
and,&rdquo; continued she, leaning her head on his shoulder, &ldquo;I
know that Siddha is mine, now and always, and no other woman lives who
can rob me of his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting his arm around her, Siddha gazed at her in silence; but his
look said more than the warmest assurance could have done. A jingling
of bangles made them look up, and Iravati said, &ldquo;Our interview,
my friend, is ended; there comes Nipunika, my servant, to warn
us.&rdquo; And a moment after, the servant appeared, her brown ancles
and arms clasped with golden bangles, and announced to her mistress
that the Governor requested her to return to her apartments, and begged
his nephew to join him and Kulluka at their meal. Giving him her hand
for a moment, Iravati, accompanied by Nipunika, returned to the palace.
Siddha followed to seek his uncle and his travelling companion. The
meal was not wanting in magnificence and luxury, and was served in one
of the smaller apartments, from the open verandah of which there was a
magnificent view of the country around. There were cushions of silk
with richly embroidered borders, on which the guests took their places;
gold and silver vessels; choice meats and wines; numbers of servants of
all nations, and in every costume; in a word, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>everything that was conformable to the rank of
Salhana, governor of the fortress, and, for the moment, the man of the
highest rank of all the inhabitants of the royal palace. But merriment
was wanting to the courtly feast, and confidential intercourse was not
possible. All was formal, stately, and stiff, and the conversation
meaningless and polite, and only sustained by the three men because
silence would have been uncourteous. How different, thought Siddha, was
their simple meal with the hermit of the mountain; and it seemed that
Kulluka was of the same opinion, for, stealing a glance at his guru, he
saw a smile on his face, unobserved by Salhana. At last their repast
came to an end, but the remainder of the day brought no pleasure to
Siddha. He wandered for some time under the balcony of the apartments
which Nipunika, whom he met, pointed out as those of her mistress. But
Iravati did not show herself, and when, towards evening, she appeared
in the presence of her father and his guests, it was only to take leave
of him with the same formality that had attended their meeting in the
morning.</p>
<p>At dawn next morning they were to recommence their journey, to avoid
the heat of mid-day, and the travellers withdrew early to their
apartments. Needful as rest was, the younger man was not inclined at
once to seek it. Taking off <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>his arms, instead of throwing himself
on his bed, he stood for some time at the open window, from which there
was a view of the whole fortress, and all the thickets of trees,
half-hidden in the dimness of night. Behind them rose hills, with here
and there temples and other sacred buildings. His mind was not alone
occupied with Iravati&rsquo;s image, but also with the conversation
with his uncle, and the strange meeting with the mysterious priest,
who, by some artifice or accident, had become acquainted with his
adventure with the tiger, though how, he could not guess. But to what
did all this tend? What did the man want? And Salhana the governor;
could he trust him? and were his instructions to be followed, and all
that had happened this morning kept secret from Kulluka? or would it
not be better to consult him about it?</p>
<p>An unexpected appearance made Siddha for an instant lose the thread
of his thoughts, though they were at once brought back to him. On the
nearest wall, where the low breastwork stood sharply out against the
light that still lingered in the sky, two figures suddenly showed
themselves above the parapet, who, though he could not distinguish
their features, he recognised as his uncle the governor, and Gorakh the
priest of Durga. Again the two were together, and at so late an hour.
But the most wonderful part of this apparition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>was the
entirely changed bearing of both. There was no trace of their former
stiffness and stateliness, and one gesticulated more violently than the
other, carried away by their engrossing conversation, as they walked up
and down, now towards the castle, and now towards the hills. This
continued until they were suddenly disturbed by the appearance of other
figures, which, one by one, moved along the outer wall, their emaciated
forms entirely naked with the exception of a white cord round their
necks, which here in the half light was visible in contrast with their
dark skins. On their approach Salhana disappeared, probably through
some stairs leading to the palace, invisible from where Siddha was. The
priest, immediately regaining his dignity, and pointing with his right
hand towards one of the temples, placed himself at the head of the
band, and led the way along the wall to the dark wood lying at the foot
of the rocks. A long row of figures followed him, and Siddha had long
ceased to count them ere the last disappeared in the jungle.</p>
<p>In spite of himself a slight feeling of horror had seized on him as
he saw their strange forms pass by, and associated them with the name
of the goddess to whose service Gorakh was dedicated, and to whose
temple they appeared bound. Could it be true that the sect <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>still
existed, of which he had so often heard, but believed to be either
rooted out or to have died out&mdash;that mysterious league of demons
in human form that had so long been the plague and terror of Hindustan,
the most terrible product that religious fanaticism had ever brought to
life? And with the leader of such a band was it possible that his
uncle, the servant of the Emperor, should be allied! It was indeed not
to be believed, and laughing at his foolish fancies, Siddha left the
window, and hastily throwing off his clothes, flung himself on the bed
prepared for him. But it was long before he could sleep, for the
conflicting images of Iravati, Salhana, Gorakh, and his naked
followers, kept passing through his head; and before he fell asleep he
had come to the determination not to speak to Kulluka of what he had
that day seen and heard. That his uncle was mixed up with secret
affairs was clear to him; still for a statesman that was not unnatural,
and there was nothing to make him suspect they were criminal, though
their discovery might be injurious to Salhana, and perhaps to his
nearest relatives. He would not, he felt, be justified in betraying
what confidential conversation and a pure accident had made him
acquainted with. Kulluka himself would certainly condemn such a course
of action. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=

<p class="first">The call of trumpets sounding gaily awoke Siddha from
his morning sleep, and, on springing up and looking out of the window,
he saw the great court before the castle filled with horsemen, half of
whom were occupied in unsaddling their horses, while the others were
mounting and forming in line. These, with whom our travellers were to
continue their journey, were on the point of starting for Agra, to
relieve the soldiers just arrived; and amongst them Siddha saw his
servant waiting with his grey charger. It took him but a few minutes to
finish his preparations for the journey, and he was in the saddle some
moments before Kulluka and the Governor appeared. But in the meantime,
before the cavalcade moved off, Siddha <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>found an opportunity to
ride round the corner of the bastion to the balcony towards which, the
day before, he had so often and so vainly looked. This time it was not
in vain, for between the plants that covered the balcony he caught
sight of a well-known figure, dressed in white, who at his approach
waved a handkerchief in the gentle breeze; and as he drew nearer, she
let it slowly fall; but he, quickly turning his horse, caught it on the
point of his lance. It was one of the brightly coloured tissues of
Kashmir, fine as a spider&rsquo;s web, well calculated to be the
despair of all the weavers in the world, and as easily drawn through a
finger-ring as bound into a turban. He quickly pressed to his lips this
parting gift so precious to him; then, binding it to the hilt of his
sabre, he waved a farewell, and in a few bounds had rejoined his
travelling companions. Salhana accompanied his guests for a short
distance, and then took leave, telling his nephew that he hoped before
long to see him again, as in a few days he thought of visiting Agra
himself. Our travellers continued their way, in company with the
commanding officer of the detachment.</p>
<p>The journey lasted for more than one day, generally by or near the
banks of the Jamuna, and led through sandy plains, where stones were
more frequently met with than trees, though sometimes they came to
lovely hills clad in green. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>At length the evening of their last
halt came, at a short distance from Agra, and on the following morning
a short ride took them to the city of the Emperor, the view of which
more than repaid them for the weariness of their journey.</p>
<p>In a semicircle on the opposite shore of the river, lay, between
garden and fortification, the long row of palaces and mosques, which
made, at this time and for long after, Agra, or Akbarabad, one of the
most beautiful as well as one of the most magnificent cities in the
world. In the middle, standing above all, as brooking no rivalry, stood
the palace of the Emperor.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1495src" href=
"#xd20e1495" name="xd20e1495src">1</a> The central building, which from
the delicate joining of its red, smooth-polished sandstones, seemed
hewn from a cloud of granite glittering in the sunshine, was surrounded
on all sides by small pleasure-houses and thick clumps of trees. This
building, from its colossal size, with its numerous cupolas, and slight
towers, with their delicate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>tracery visible against the blue sky,
could not fail to strike the beholder with wonder and admiration.
Around the central palace were the pleasure-houses of the great
courtiers, of rich noblemen and prosperous citizens, and mosques with
their cupolas and minarets, while here and there a few solitary temples
were the only witnesses of a civilisation whose ascendancy belonged to
the past.</p>
<p>The beauty of the view made the travellers draw rein, and gaze on it
with delight. One man alone, a mighty conqueror and deep-thinking
reformer, had, as though by magic, called this splendour and beauty to
life, as it were, from the barren plain. A feeling of anxiety crept
over Siddha as he thought how soon he would meet him, and perhaps
exchange a few words, formal though they might be.</p>
<p>On reaching the other side of the river, they took leave of the
officer who had been their travelling companion, and, with their
servant, made their way to a house that had been hired for them by a
friend of Kulluka. It was simply but tastefully and comfortably
arranged, with cheerful views of the gardens around, and of the river
that lay glittering in the morning sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, this will do,&rdquo; said Kulluka, as he entered;
&ldquo;and I see the camels with our baggage have arrived. We must not
be idle, but dress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>ourselves, and at once go to wait on
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl the Minister. Now for a bath, and meantime Vatsa can
unpack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later both were ready for the visit, Siddha in a dress
of cloth-of-gold, reaching to the knees, and opening a little at the
throat, showing a pearl necklace. On his head was a turban ornamented
with a feather. Kulluka was also dressed with elegance and with less
severe simplicity than hitherto. They were armed with sabre and dagger,
but more for show than use.</p>
<p>It was not far to the palace of the Minister, and passing through
the courtyard, they gave their names to a servant, who immediately
showed them into one of the inner apartments, to await the coming of
the Wazir; but their patience was not put to proof. The curtain that
separated their apartment from others was soon drawn aside, and
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl entered. He was a man of middle height, rather
inclined to corpulence, and about fifty years of age. He was dressed in
a costly garment of yellow flowered silk, wore no beard, and his smooth
countenance, in spite of a look of weariness, expressed manly strength
and a strong resolute will, though this was tempered by kindly dark
eyes.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1512src" href="#xd20e1512" name=
"xd20e1512src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to see you here so soon,&rdquo;
said he, after the usual greetings, which on the part of Kulluka and
Siddha were full of respect. &ldquo;Our young friend shows himself no
laggard in entering the Emperor&rsquo;s service&mdash;thanks, I
suppose, to your inciting, O wise Kulluka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would indeed have been a bad beginning,&rdquo; was the
reply, &ldquo;if he had delayed a moment longer than was necessary in
assuming the position which your favour and the Emperor&rsquo;s had
assigned him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No favour, my friend,&rdquo; interrupted Ab&uacute;-l Fazl,
&ldquo;but a wise choice, I hope. We do not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>consider
it needful to give all appointments to our own noblemen, but hold them
out also as prizes to the native nobility of countries that are allied
with us. And you know that our Rajputs would see with displeasure their
commanders chosen from any but their own countrymen. And what could
give me greater pleasure than to call the son of an old and tried
friend to a post that his father wished to see him fill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, my lord,&rdquo; said Siddha, as the Minister
finished, &ldquo;allow me to look upon it as a favour, and to thank you
most heartily both for my father and for myself, and I hope to prove
myself not unworthy of your goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all, be faithful,&rdquo; said Ab&uacute;-l Fazl,
gravely. &ldquo;Perhaps this recommendation appears needless to you;
but when you have been here longer you will discover that treachery
lurks in every corner, and even the best may sometimes be led away and
become faithless. To-morrow, meantime, your commander will give you the
necessary instructions for your service, and he will warn you to be
careful with your Rajputs, for you know that many of them, although
their position is lowly, are noble as you yourself, and you cannot
treat them as though they were common soldiers. Now, doubtless, you
wish to see more of the city than you have yet done, and I will not
keep you. But wait a moment,&rdquo; he continued, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>as
Siddha rose to take his leave; &ldquo;a guide would be welcome to you,
and I think I can give you a good one.&rdquo; Clapping his hands, he
asked the servant who appeared, &ldquo;Is my nephew Parviz in the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just seen him in the courtyard,&rdquo; answered the
servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that I wish to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes a young man appeared, of about Siddha&rsquo;s age,
richly dressed, and with ornaments of pearls and jewels. His face was
pleasing, but, in spite of a black moustache, somewhat feminine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parviz,&rdquo; said Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, &ldquo;you see here
our two visitors from Kashmir, of whose coming I spoke to you; the
noble Siddha I hope you will soon call your friend; and now will you
serve him as guide, for this is his first visit to our city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, uncle,&rdquo; answered Parviz, as he greeted
Siddha with friendliness; &ldquo;it will be as much a pleasure as an
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go,&rdquo; said the Minister; &ldquo;Kulluka will
perhaps remain a little longer with me, to talk over the affairs of
Kashmir. <a id="xd20e1545" name="xd20e1545"></a>But, gentlemen,&rdquo;
said he, more to Siddha than to the Brahman, &ldquo;do not forget to
visit my brother Faizi to-day; he might take it amiss if you put off
doing so until to-morrow, although he would not grudge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>me the
preference.&rdquo; And making them a friendly sign of farewell, the two
young men left the palace together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Parviz, &ldquo;luckily it is not so very
hot, and we can go at once to see&mdash;what to our visitors to Agra is
the greatest of all the sights&mdash;the Palace of the
Emperor&mdash;that is if the walk is not too far for you, after your
long ride of this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered Siddha, quickly becoming familiar with
his new friend, &ldquo;I care as little for heat as for cold&mdash;we
are well accustomed to both amongst our mountains; nor do we think much
of fatigue. But I am sorry to give you the trouble of showing me what
you must often have seen before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though not so indifferent to weather,&rdquo; said Parviz,
jestingly, &ldquo;as you who come from wild mountains and forests,
still I can manage a short walk, and, even if it is hot, all
inconvenience will be forgotten in the pleasure of your
companionship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon became more familiar, and confided to each other their
various affairs and concerns. Parviz, among other things, told Siddha
that he had no taste for military service, and that his uncle thought
him unfitted for it, and therefore destined him for some civil
employment. Thus talking they came to a fine broad street that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>formed one of the principal approaches to the
royal palace. This street ended in a gateway in the form of a triumphal
arch. Passing through it they entered a large <i>maidan</i>
overshadowed with plane-trees. Six other streets equally broad opened
on this space, under similar arches; in the middle stood a colossal
stone elephant, the trunk of which formed a fountain, throwing up jets
of water. Three sides of the place were shut in by marble colonnades,
behind which arose gradually the different stories of the building.
Though this view was not so striking or picturesque as that from the
river, yet the extraordinary extent of palace, with its various
buildings and fortifications, was more apparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; said Parviz, &ldquo;that it is
impossible to visit all we see at once; even if we were proof against
fatigue, we should not have the time. But let us take a glance around,
so that you may be able to form an idea of the whole, and later you
will become acquainted with it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they entered one of the verandahs Parviz spoke to the guard, who
at once called a servant to guide them to those apartments that were
accessible to visitors of their rank. Following him, they passed
through long rows of rooms, each furnished with more splendour than the
last, and all built in the light Moorish style, with charming
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>views of the gardens around, with their fountains
and luxuriant growth of flowers of all kinds. Here were marble walls,
inlaid with flowers in delicate Mosaics; there, from all corners, tiny
fountains filled the air with coolness; everywhere curtains and
hangings of silk, embroidered with gold and silver; and heavy carpets,
and soft silken cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the other wing,&rdquo; said Parviz, &ldquo;are things
still more beautiful; but they are not shown, for there are the
women&rsquo;s apartments. I have had just a glance at one or two before
they were finished, and while they were uninhabited. The great audience
hall, is it open?&rdquo; he said, turning to the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;but in a few
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not signify,&rdquo; interrupted Parviz.
&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; continued he to Siddha, &ldquo;there will be a
public audience given, and we can then see it. As to the apartments of
the Emperor, in all probability you will soon become well acquainted
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They then took their way through high, broad galleries, filled with
servants and soldiers, and then through the pleasure-grounds, while
Parviz pointed out to his companion the various halls and buildings,
telling him to what purposes they were destined. Here was the imperial
library, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>with its richly bound manuscripts; yonder the
work-room of the goldsmith and jeweller, and laboratories of the
perfumers, the store-houses and kitchens, and also the arsenal of the
fortress, and stables for the horses, elephants, and camels, kept for
the use of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Siddha had considered himself well acquainted with palaces, but the
conviction now crept over him that, until this moment, he had never
seen one. The extent of the stables struck him with astonishment,
appearing like a village from the compound round which they were
built.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a number of noble animals there must be there!&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Parviz, &ldquo;there are at least a
hundred elephants here; and I scarcely know how many are kept for the
Emperor in other places, but according to report he has as many again,
and equal numbers of horses and hunting-leopards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Siddha, &ldquo;what can any one, even
though he be the great Akbar, do with such profusion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much for himself,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Less
perhaps than you imagine. Born in a wilderness, while his father
wandered in banishment, and brought up in a camp, he places no value on
all this excessive luxury; but he is convinced, I believe, that a
prince like him, in these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>countries and among such people as he
governs, has as great need of a striking magnificence as of a fine army
and experienced statesmen. We all&mdash;Persians, Mughals, Arabs, or
Hindus, your people as well as ours&mdash;are accustomed to feel
greater respect for a monarch the more outward show he makes. But you
must not think that with all this show there is also great prodigality.
On the contrary, I can assure you nothing is lost or wasted, and in the
smallest affairs of this great court there is the same strict order as
in the different departments of government, which can perhaps
everywhere in the kingdom of the Great Mughal be held up as an example
of what intelligent administration should be. My uncle Ab&uacute;-l
Fazl is busied in describing all this exactly in his great work on the
institutions and the government of the Emperor,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1592src" href="#xd20e1592" name="xd20e1592src">3</a> in which he
allows me to help him occasionally. But there are some things in which
Akbar may be called prodigal, especially in aiding those who are in
trouble and difficulties, and who have some claim on his liberality;
and also in the advancement of science and art. As regards these, his
treasurer has some trouble in keeping him within bounds. But
now,&rdquo; continued Parviz, after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>&ldquo;it is about time to be returning; the sun
commences to burn, and I must confess to a little fatigue. If we loiter
here longer I shall be inclined to repose on one of these seats, and
await the coolness of the evening; but in this way we should lose our
meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let us turn back,&rdquo; answered Siddha; &ldquo;and I
thank you heartily for your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a by-path on the other side of the garden and building,
Parviz guided his friend back to his lodging, and there taking leave,
he said, &ldquo;To-morrow probably you will be too busy with your
appointment to see more of our town; but the day after, or later, I
shall gladly be at your orders, only let me know if I am to come for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two young men took leave of each other, and Siddha sought, in a
cool apartment, the mid-day rest, which he found far from unwelcome.
When evening fell, he, with his elder friend, took their way to Faizi,
brother of the Minister. A comfortable and tastefully built bungalow,
surrounded by thickly growing trees, was the habitation of Ab&uacute;-l
Fazl&rsquo;s younger brother. They were immediately admitted, and
presently a servant appeared, to lead them to Faizi&rsquo;s own
apartment. There, close to a verandah that ran round the greater part
of the building, sat a man, in the prime of life, bending <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>over a
table covered with papers. Around him, on the ground, were scattered
many others. He rose to meet his visitors without any formality, and
holding out his hand with a simple welcome, signed to them to seat
themselves with him on the cushions before the verandah.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1605src" href="#xd20e1605" name=
"xd20e1605src">4</a></p>
<p>What principally distinguished Faizi from his elder brother was the
frank, joyous expression of his smoothly shaven countenance, and a
peculiar easiness of manner, mixed with the courtly forms of a man of
the world. His calm and tranquil look was more characteristic of a
quiet thinker than of a man of warlike experience, although as a
warrior he had not failed in many a brave deed, and as ambassador had
aided in setting at rest many an intricate question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew well,&rdquo; he said, as a servant offered wine and
refreshments, &ldquo;that you would not let the day pass, worthy
Kulluka, without giving me, as well as my brother, the pleasure of
seeing you and making acquaintance with your young friend, who, before
long, I hope to call mine. And what do you think of our new
city?&rdquo; he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>asked Siddha. &ldquo;You must already have seen
something of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your nephew Parviz, noble lord,&rdquo; answered Siddha,
&ldquo;was so kind as to show me a part of the palace this morning; but
to tell the truth, I cannot at this moment form an opinion of it. I am
now simply overcome with astonishment at so much magnificence and such
a profusion of splendid works of art. I had imagined much, but my
imagination fell far short of the reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can easily believe,&rdquo; rejoined Faizi: &ldquo;it
happens to everyone on their first arrival here. However much one may
have heard or read of Akbar&rsquo;s palace beforehand, one is overcome
with astonishment on really seeing it. But tell me, Kulluka, how things
go in the north; I am anxious to hear news of your Kashmir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kulluka willingly replied, keeping to general affairs, and without
then alluding to the divisions that were beginning to arise; and soon
Siddha also took a lively share in the conversation. Never before had
he found himself so quickly at his ease with a stranger as he did with
the celebrated Faizi, the great Emperor&rsquo;s friend and councillor,
and of whose learning and knowledge he had heard so much. The
conversation soon passed from the subjects of the day to various
topics, especially those relating to literature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admire our palaces,&rdquo; said Faizi, turning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>to Siddha, &ldquo;and say they far out-do your
expectations; but it was quite the contrary with me when I first made
acquaintance with your simple, classical, and sacred literature. Our
faithful were not very learned; Mullahs had assured me they were
nothing but a confused and tasteless collection of monstrosities, as
pernicious to our civilisation as dangerous to our belief in Allah and
His Prophet. I say nothing about this last accusation; but as to what
concerns the cultivation of taste and knowledge, I find far more aid in
your poets and thinkers than in ours. How splendid is your heroic
poetry, how fine your lyrics, and sparkling your dramas! what noble,
elevated feelings, yet, at the same time, what purity and humanity, and
what a breadth and depth of thought was there in your philosophers of
old! But why should I remind you of all this, which you naturally know
and understand far better than I do, who with great difficulty have
learnt to understand your language, which is so entirely different from
our Persian or Arabic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Siddha, &ldquo;Sanscrit does not come
so naturally to us Hindus, who generally speak Hindustani. Ask Kulluka
if he did not find difficulties in teaching it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even,&rdquo; remarked Kulluka, &ldquo;even if in the
beginning Faizi found the same difficulties in learning Sanscrit that
others have done, his translation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>of our Kashmiri chronicles, and
his rendering of Nala and Damayanti,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1634src" href="#xd20e1634" name="xd20e1634src">5</a> can well
make us forget that the language is not his native one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What splendid poetry, is it not?&rdquo; continued Faizi, who
did not let the conversation easily drop when it once touched on Hindu
literature; &ldquo;and how far short any translation must fall when
compared with the original, so simple and yet so exalted, with its
unsurpassed women! Think of the noble, pure Damayanti, proof against
all the trials and slights of her unworthy husband! My translations
have been undertaken to please Akbar, who naturally cannot find time
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>to learn a strange language, and yet is desirous
of reading everything. Now he has given me the task of translating the
Evangelists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; asked Kulluka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the holy books used by the people of the West, who are
called Christians, after the founder of their religion, of whom you
must have heard. There is much worth reading in those books, and I find
many exalted and profound ideas in them, mixed with matter of less
consequence, as is also the case with your philosophies; but on the
whole there is not much that is new to those who are acquainted with
your philosophical writings. But what always strikes me
particularly,&rdquo; he continued, again turning the conversation to
the praise of ancient India, &ldquo;are your proverbs. How insipid ours
appear when compared with them! Even if I had only learnt this one of
you, it would have been enough to give me fresh courage for working at
my manuscript,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;The treasure that never fades is never
robbed, but grows</p>
<p class="line">The more it is expended; that treasure is called
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Is that right?&rdquo; said he, turning to
Siddha; &ldquo;or have I made some fault in the
pronunciation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Siddha hesitated, but glancing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>at
Kulluka, who smiled and nodded to him, he replied, with confidence,
&ldquo;Not quite right, my lord; but the mistake is a very slight
one.&rdquo; And repeating the word in fault, he showed how it should be
pronounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am fortunate,&rdquo; cried Faizi, joyfully; &ldquo;but
do repeat one of the sayings from Bhartrihari;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1661src" href="#xd20e1661" name="xd20e1661src">6</a> no doubt you
know many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Siddha thought for a moment, and then recited:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Every one who lives was born, but only
those are truly born</p>
<p class="line">Who, dying, leave a name to their
descendants.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; laughed Faizi, &ldquo;in your
Kashmir you have learnt other things than Sanscrit,&mdash;you are also
learned in the art of flattery, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flattery?&rdquo; asked Siddha. &ldquo;Should not your name
and that of your brother Ab&uacute;-l Fazl&mdash;that have penetrated
from Persia to the furthest districts of Hindustan&mdash;should not
your names be preserved by coming generations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;yes, that
will not lightly be forgotten: preserved, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>perhaps, not so much
through his deeds as through his immortal work, the &lsquo;Akbar
Nama,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1680src" href="#xd20e1680"
name="xd20e1680src">7</a> in which he describes the history of our
great Emperor&rsquo;s reign. That is indeed a book, my friend, in
comparison with which all my writings sink to nothing. But I have
remarked to him that he raises Akbar too much to the clouds; for after
all, he, as a man, has his faults, like others, and perhaps in the
future he may be accused of flattery of princes and of prejudice. But
he would not listen to me, nor in the least diminish his praise of the
Emperor. &lsquo;If I,&rsquo; he answered me, &lsquo;may not say all
that I in truth think of the man, who is more than my prince&mdash;he
is my benefactor and truest friend,&mdash;rather than not say what I
think, I would throw my book away.&rsquo; As you can understand,
against all that there was no reasoning; and one can see also that to
Akbar, although he says nothing, the praise of a friend whose opinion
he prizes so highly is very welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble Faizi,&rdquo; said Siddha, interrupting a short
silence, &ldquo;may I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and I hope to be able
to answer it frankly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, when we spoke of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>warning he gave me this morning crossed my mind.
He warned me against treachery that here surrounds the Emperor. Do you,
whose opinion is of such great weight, believe that there can be people
here so foolish and so criminal as to league themselves against so
great and beneficent a prince as Akbar; can it really be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Faizi; &ldquo;my brother sees treachery
everywhere; but after all, that is but natural to a Minister, and still
more to the first, the great Wazir. However, you may make yourself
easy; people here are not so base, nor are they so foolish, as to
engage in a game in which their heads are the stakes, and the chances
ten to one against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faizi,&rdquo; said Kulluka, gravely and half reproachfully,
&ldquo;your hopeful views prove your good heart; but do you not think
that they may be sometimes dangerous to young people, and lead them, as
for example might be the case with our inexperienced friend here, into
imprudence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see that he is inclined to want of caution,&rdquo;
was the reply; &ldquo;and I only mean that it is better that he should
not begin with his head full of imaginations of court and state
intrigues, but enter life with confidence and courage. We all began so,
and dangers never harmed us. If he begins with too much suspicion, he
will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>end by trusting no one, not even my brother or
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could never be,&rdquo; cried Siddha, quickly, as he
looked confidently into Faizi&rsquo;s friendly face. &ldquo;As little
as I could ever suspect secret enmity from you, so little could you
expect faithlessness and treachery from one who prizes your friendship
and good opinion as highly as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember what you have said,&rdquo; Kulluka remarked,
gravely; &ldquo;and think, too, that no one has the power of foreseeing
all the events and circumstances that may end in influencing him,
short-sighted as he is, to give up his free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Faizi, in his usual joyous tone, &ldquo;here
we are again in philosophy. You know well it is my favourite subject,
although I have not made so much progress in it as Kulluka maintains.
Let us call for lights&mdash;night begins to close in&mdash;and we will
have some discussion touching Sankhya and Vedanta,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1706src" href="#xd20e1706" name="xd20e1706src">8</a> in which
he is so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>strong. What a pity that we cannot ask Akbar to
join us! he finds more pleasure in the driest philosophical discussion
than in the most sparkling banquets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing should I like better, honoured Faizi,&rdquo; answered
Kulluka, &ldquo;than to pass an hour with you deep in such subjects, as
in past days; but now I am afraid we must go, Siddha must take over his
command early to-morrow morning, and I have much to settle to-night in
readiness for my departure, which is fixed for the day after to-morrow.
Will you, then, excuse us if we take our leave, and thank you for your
reception&mdash;as kind and friendly as ever it was in days gone
by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will excuse you, my worthy friend,&rdquo; answered
Faizi, as he called to a servant to show them out.
&ldquo;Siddha,&rdquo; he said, as he took leave, &ldquo;we were
speaking of imprudences; be on your guard against them. But a young man
like you may happen to fall into them as well at your court as at ours;
and if you ever find yourself in any difficulty, come straight to
Faizi, who may be able to keep you out of the fire.&rdquo; And without
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>waiting for either answer or thanks, he turned
back to his own apartments.</p>
<p>Who could have asked for more, on his entry into life, than was
given to Siddha! Neither councillors nor support failed him. For
important affairs there was the hermit of the mountain; for more
trifling difficulties the wise and influential Faizi. The favour of the
First Minister had already been granted him, and that of the Emperor
himself was promised him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=

Akbar&rsquo;s palace, in the fort of Agra, is built entirely of red
sandstone. It is a square building, 249 feet by 260 feet. In the centre
is a courtyard, 71 feet by 72 feet, on either side of which are two
halls facing one another. Every feature round this court is of pure
Hindu architecture. There are no arches, but the horizontal style of
construction everywhere. General Cunningham, as Mr. Fergusson thinks
erroneously, ascribes this palace to Jahangir. He describes it in his
&ldquo;Reports,&rdquo; vol. iv. p. 124, and gives a plan (Plate
xiii.).</p>

Ab&uacute;-l Fazl (called Allami) was a son of Shaikh Mubarak, son of
Shaikh Khizr, who came from Sind. Mubarak was one of the most learned
men of his day, and inclined to be a free-thinker. Ab&uacute;-l Fazl,
his second son, was born on January 14th, 1551. He was a devoted
student, and his range of reading was very extensive. His elder
brother, Faizi, had been invited to the court of Akbar in the twelfth
year of that sovereign&rsquo;s reign, and by his means Ab&uacute;-l
Fazl was introduced in 1568, when in his seventeenth year. His
abilities were immediately recognised, and every year he grew in favour
and power. He was made Prime Minister and Mansabdar of four thousand,
discharging his duties with distinguished abilities and success. Both
brothers inherited the liberal opinions of their father, and carried
them to greater extremes. Hence orthodox Muslims reviled them as
apostates and free-thinkers. In them Akbar found congenial minds, with
feelings and opinions similar to but more decided than his own. The
murder of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl on August 12th, 1602, is noted further on.
He was the author of the &ldquo;Akbar-namah&rdquo; (2 vols.), a history
of his master&rsquo;s reign down to 1602, and of the
&ldquo;A&rsquo;&iacute;n-i-Akbari.&rdquo;</p>

brother.</p>

story of Nala and Damayanti is a beautiful episode in the
&ldquo;Mahabharata,&rdquo; which was translated into Persian by Faizi,
and into English by Dean Milman. Nala, King of Nishadha, had been
chosen by the lovely Princess Damayanti for her husband, but the
vindictive demon Kali was the enemy of Nala, and was determined to
effect his ruin. He perverted the king&rsquo;s mind by urging him to
play at dice with his brother Pushkara. Nala lost his kingdom and all
he had, but refused to play for his wife; and the royal pair wandered
away destitute from the palace. Nala, still instigated by the demon,
deserted his weary, sleeping wife, and left her exposed in the forest.
She at length found a hospitable refuge. Nala engaged himself as a
charioteer, and was eventually restored to his faithful wife. Freed
from the power of Kali, and fortified with a preternatural amount of
skill in gaming, he finally won back his kingdom.</p>

Sankhya system of philosophy was founded by Kapila. Its aim was rest,
or exemption from transmigration, to be attained by looking steadily at
the whole united universe, and recognising that man, and all which is
created, is transitory, but that beyond the transitory is the eternal.
The doctrine of Kapila is taught in six <i>Sutras</i> or lectures. His
main position is that absolute prevention of all three sorts of pain is
the highest purpose of the soul. The three sorts of pain are evil
proceeding from self, from eternal beings, and from divine causes.
Deliverance from these evils is attainable by knowledge of the
twenty-five true principles of existence.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter IV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Akbar.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early next morning, on the great <i>maidan</i> of the
fortress, our young soldier took over the command of his detachment
from the chief mansabdar<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1738src" href=
"#xd20e1738" name="xd20e1738src">1</a> of the Rajputs. The officer
above him exacted a strict observance of discipline; but to that
Kulluka&rsquo;s pupil was well accustomed, and he himself saw the
necessity for it. This mansabdar, too,&mdash;who presented him with the
white feather and other symbols of his rank,&mdash;in spite of the
severity of his disposition, was a man of cultivation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>and
courteous, friendly manners. Siddha was equally pleased with the
appearance of his men, clad in the same splendid array as their
leaders. They were splendid riders, with soldier-like bearing, and
countenances sparkling with life and courage.</p>
<p>At the request of the commander, Siddha put his troopers through
some evolutions, which gave him the opportunity of showing off his own
admirable riding and the training of his horse. Had Kulluka been
present at these exercises he would have seen with satisfaction the
approbation with which his pupil was regarded by his superiors. After
some evolutions with all the troops assembled, the bugle signalled that
the exercises for the day were over, and commanded the retreat. Siddha,
giving his horse to Vatsa, who was in waiting, turned his footsteps
towards one of the gardens of the palace, to which officers of his rank
had access. But before he had reached the court he saw a young woman
approaching him by one of the side-paths, who, from her attire,
appeared to be a servant belonging to some great house. As she drew
near she hesitated for a moment, and then said, &ldquo;Are you not, my
lord, the noble Siddha, just arrived from Kashmir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;you seem to know
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not personally,&rdquo; said the servant; &ldquo;but the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>noble lady who sent me gave me your description.
She requests a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with you, if you will
have the kindness to grant them to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Siddha, &ldquo;who is your
mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, my lord,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;if I
withhold her name for the present; doubtless she will herself enlighten
you, if you honour her with a visit, and, if you will, she expects you
this evening. Come at about ten, by that mosque.&rdquo; And she pointed
to a beautiful building on a height, whose gilded cupolas and marble
minarets were sparkling in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Siddha hesitated and sought for an answer. An adventure&mdash;and he
thought of Iravati. A plot&mdash;and he remembered the warning of
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the maid, mockingly. &ldquo;A soldier like
you, and not know what to do when an illustrious lady asks for a short
conversation! You are not afraid, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; cried Siddha, while a flush of anger mounted
to his face. &ldquo;What gives you the right&mdash;but,&rdquo;
continued he, restraining himself, &ldquo;my irresolution may appear
strange, but the reasons are no concern of yours. Meet me at the
appointed time at the mosque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; replied the woman; and greeting him, she
returned the way she had come.</p>
<p>For a moment Siddha thought of attempting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>to
follow her unseen, and so to discover with whom he had to do; but a
moment&rsquo;s consideration convinced him she certainly would be on
her guard. Dissatisfied with the whole affair, and with himself, he
continued his walk, and soon reached the garden.</p>
<p>Rich and magnificent as it was, there was more to fatigue than
satisfy the eye. Straight paths, one resembling another, paved with
smooth polished stones, were shaded by trees; and there were tanks
bordered with marble, from the centres of which fountains of various
forms arose. The groups of trees in all directions threw thick, cool
shade, inviting the passers-by to repose. After having wandered for
some time without meeting any one, Siddha saw a middle-aged and
powerfully-built man seated under the shade of one of these trees.
There was something in the man&rsquo;s appearance that immediately
excited his attention, though he could scarcely have given a reason.
The stranger was distinguished from the courtiers he had met, by
something that words can hardly convey. The expression of his face,
closely shaven, like others, was calm and frank; neither handsome nor
the contrary, his attire was rich yet simple; and excepting the
elaborately worked hilt of his sword, his only ornament was a diamond
of extraordinary size that glittered in the folds of his turban. But
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>what neither ornaments nor beauty of feature could
give, was the peculiar expression and bearing that Siddha had remarked
in Gurupada the hermit, but which was still more marked in this man,
and bespoke him a ruler. Still, in the unknown he did not suspect more
than a courtier or a great warrior attached to some prince who was in
attendance at Akbar&rsquo;s court. With a silent greeting he was about
to pass by, when the stranger addressed him by name, and without rising
or further introduction, asked if he had made acquaintance with his
Rajputs. Somewhat surprised that everyone should know who he was,
Siddha replied in the affirmative, and the other proceeded in
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the heron&rsquo;s feathers I recognised your rank, and
knowing all your fellow-officers personally, and knowing also that you
were expected to take up your appointment, I had no difficulty in
guessing who you were. And how do you like your appointment? Sit down
by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should indeed be ungrateful,&rdquo; said Siddha, accepting
the invitation, which sounded more like a command, and scarcely
noticing that the stranger treated him as an inferior,&mdash;&ldquo;I
should indeed be ungrateful to my benefactor and the Emperor if I did
not highly prize the noble occupation in which they have placed
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor!&rdquo; repeated the other; &ldquo;well,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>yes. But tell me, do you come to serve him, or
simply to enjoy the privileges that your rank gives you at his
court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hard question, noble lord,&rdquo; answered Siddha, frankly,
&ldquo;and one I have never put to myself; but still I can answer
without difficulty, that, above all, I should desire faithfully to
serve the Emperor, as far as honour and duty allow. My having entered
into his service of my own free will testifies to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prudently answered,&rdquo; remarked the stranger; &ldquo;but
now the question is, what do you understand by honour and
duty?&mdash;those are difficult words to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some,&rdquo; replied Siddha; &ldquo;but I do not find
them so. I take them in their strongest meaning. Honour and duty would
forbid me to undertake anything against my country, even if Akbar
himself should give the orders; and in that case to give up all the
privileges secured to me by his favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would do well,&rdquo; replied the other, approvingly;
&ldquo;but what reasons have you for imagining that the Emperor would
ever require from you what would be to the prejudice of yourself and
your countrymen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Siddha hesitated, as the conversation with his uncle
crossed his mind. But quickly recovering himself, and looking in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>stranger&rsquo;s open face, he asked, with no
further introduction, &ldquo;Is not Akbar ambitious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger, in a tone and with
a look that made Siddha involuntarily shrink from his side,
&ldquo;until now you have contented yourself with prudent remarks; but,
at the court of Akbar himself, so to express yourself to a perfect
stranger appears to me rather rash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may appear so,&rdquo; answered Siddha, without
embarrassment. &ldquo;I do not know you, that is true; but to know your
name or rank is indifferent to me. I see you and hear your voice, and
know that it would be impossible for you to betray or harm a young and
inexperienced man, who has trusted you and spoken frankly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These simple words caused a look of pleasure to cross the
stranger&rsquo;s countenance, not of flattered vanity, but a nobler and
purer feeling of satisfaction. Flattery was not strange to him, nor was
he insensible to it. But these were words from the heart, spoken in
ignorance of who he was, and praising in him that which he prized above
everything.</p>
<p>He said, laying his hand on Siddha&rsquo;s shoulder, while his voice
sounded gentler, &ldquo;What you have said is true. You trust me, you
say, though you do not know me; do the same when the time comes that
you know me well. But now for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>Akbar. He is ambitious: in that you
are right. I know him, and all is not so well as I could wish, and I
agree that he is ambitious; but then, in what way? Do you really
believe that his only desire is to add more and more kingdoms and
peoples to his empire, which already is far too extended? Should he not
be content with what he already has? I think the small kingdom of Agra
and Delhi were his sole inheritance. Little if anything else was left
him by Humayun,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1803src" href="#xd20e1803"
name="xd20e1803src">2</a> his unfortunate and sorely tried father; and
at present his dominions extend from the borders of Persia to the
furthest extremes of Bengal, and to the districts of the Dakhin and
Golkonda. Then why do you imagine to yourself new conquests, and
especially that of your far-distant Kashmir, which would not repay the
many sacrifices that would be necessary to attain it. Still, reasons
might arise which would force a prince no longer to respect the
independence of neighbouring states; that is, if they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>should
threaten to become dangerous for the peace and prosperity of his own
people. And in such a case he must act, although he would gladly leave
his sword in the scabbard; and although the peace and liberty of
surrounding nations are as dear to him as those of his own dominions.
Still all this does not prevent the descendant of Baber and
Timur<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1808src" href="#xd20e1808" name=
"xd20e1808src">3</a> from being ambitious; and from his earliest
manhood his ambition has been not only to found a great and mighty
empire, but, above all, to ensure the happiness, prosperity, and
cultivation of the people that the great Power has entrusted to him. He
has striven to improve their condition, and to calm the jealousies and
divisions of the different races, to put an end to religious disputes,
and to bridle the tyranny and oppression of the powerful and selfish
nobles. He has tried to benefit the industrious classes of Bengal, and
striven to increase prosperity everywhere, to encourage science and
art, and to raise his subjects to a state of cultivation and
enlightenment for which many have shown great aptitude. Say, if you
will, frankly, that this is too much for one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>mortal
to accomplish, and I shall not contradict you; but the striving after
an ideal should not be condemned even if it is unattainable. And, in
truth, Akbar&rsquo;s own ideal will never be fulfilled. How many years
of thought and toil has he devoted to this goal; and how far, alas! is
he now from attaining it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With respect and awe Siddha listened, as, carried away with his
subject, the stranger rose to his feet, lifting his hand toward heaven;
but as he finished, dejectedly he sank back, bending his head on that
breast which contained a warm and noble heart. For a moment Siddha felt
inclined to rise to his feet, not doubting but that he saw before him
the Emperor himself; but then the idea that so great a man should so
confide in a young, unknown stranger appeared too absurd to be reality.
As he was about to attempt, by roundabout questions, to find out with
whom he was speaking, approaching footsteps interrupted the
conversation, and presently a man appeared, short and bent, clad in
grave garments, and with what was rare at court, a thick black
beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abdul Kadir,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1817src" href=
"#xd20e1817" name="xd20e1817src">4</a> said the stranger, more to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>himself than to Siddha, while a dark cloud crossed
his countenance. Notwithstanding, he greeted the new comer with
courtesy, at the same time making him a sign that he wished to remain
unknown.</p>
<p>With a defiant glance Abdul Kadir looked at Siddha, who had stepped
on one side, from head to foot, and then turned his back on him,
without saying a word. That the blood rose to the cheeks of our Indian
nobleman at such treatment was not surprising; but as he was about to
demand an explanation of the insult, the stranger restrained him, and
said, &ldquo;Do not, noble Siddha, allow the treatment of my friend
here to arouse your anger. It is not personally meant, of that I am
sure; but he cannot bear the sight of you Hindus, as he imagines that
you damage his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>faith. Is it not so?&rdquo; he asked, turning to
Abdul Kadir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have, indeed, no
personal enmity to you, young man,&rdquo; he continued, turning to
Siddha. &ldquo;I do not know you, but to fight and strive against you,
root and branch, is to me a holy duty; and I do strive against you, and
hate you with an irreconcilable hatred. Still, as men, there are many
among you whom I respect and honour. You injure our faith, and even
make the Emperor himself averse to it. You deny Allah and mock His
Prophet, and seek to drive us, the faithful, away, and to become
masters of offices and employments, that you may put your false gods
and false doctrines in the place of the God without whom there is no
god, and of those who, in truth, acknowledge Him. Therefore, and for
that reason alone, I hate you and yours, and will strive against you
and yours till the death. You are either atheists or idolaters; in
either case you lead the people astray, and tempt the prince. Enough
that you are nothing but unbelieving&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A severe, penetrating glance from the stranger held back on the lips
of the speaker the word that was about to follow. Had it been spoken,
Siddha, in spite of all his endeavours, would scarcely have been able
to restrain his anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbelieving, then,&rdquo; continued Abdul Kadir; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>&ldquo;and that for a true son of the Prophet is
more than enough. But what can it concern you, if I, who here have
nothing to say, nor am of the slightest importance, am not one with
your race? The favour of the Emperor is assured to you, who can and
does do anything as it best pleases him. He has freed you from the
burthen justly laid on you by the true believers for your denial of the
true faith. He calls you to all employments, places you at the head of
his armies, chooses amongst you his councillors and friends. What would
you have more? Leave me, then, leave us, our just wrath. We cannot harm
you; but it may be that the anger of heaven will one day fall on your
heads, and perhaps on his, also, who showered favours on you, instead
of chastising you with the rod and the sword, which for this purpose
Allah himself placed in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; coldly said the stranger, after this
hot outbreak, &ldquo;it appears to me that our conversation so carried
on is neither profitable nor agreeable. Doubtless, friend Siddha, you
have more to say in reply to Abdul Kadir, and I myself am far from
agreeing with him. But if I do not mistake, this time he sought us not
for the sake of a fruitless dispute, but to talk over an important
affair, and on this I will willingly listen to him. Excuse me,
therefore, if for the present I say farewell, hoping that we
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>may meet again before long. Abdul Kadir,&rdquo; he
said, as with a respectful greeting Siddha took his leave, &ldquo;what
do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; was the answer,&mdash;for it was indeed Akbar
himself with whom Siddha had been conversing,&mdash;&ldquo;my duty as a
subject as well as a friend, though one of little importance, obliges
me to seek your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; interrupted Akbar; &ldquo;you are not
self-seeking, you care not for protection or favours. And yet I would
that you did; then, perhaps, I might be able to content you, in which
now I seldom or never succeed. But I suspect that it is on religious
subjects you wish to speak to me. The exaggerated words you have just
used have told me what was coming; at any rate, be so good as to use a
little moderation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; answered Abdul Kadir, &ldquo;the faith, the
one pure, true faith, is what now leads me here. For that I request a
few minutes&rsquo; conversation,&mdash;and,&rdquo; continued he, with a
stern look, &ldquo;earnest and grave conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best,&rdquo; replied Akbar, courteously;
&ldquo;and will promise not to laugh, if you will keep within
bounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will depend on your opinion,&rdquo; remarked the other;
&ldquo;but I will do my best to treat the subject calmly. To warn you,
and most earnestly to warn you, is imperative on all who mean well
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>to Shah Akbar, and yet know what has come to my
ears. As you well know, there has long been deep discontent among us
true Muhammadans, caused by state offices being placed in the hands of
men lukewarm like Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, or atheist like Faizi. But what
you do not know is that a party has arisen in the midst of your
kingdom, and in the neighbourhood even of your court, which has
irrevocably sworn to work for your fall and destruction, because you
have refused to give ear to the claims which they, as the
representatives of the ancient and only true friends of the House of
Timur, have a just right to demand. Lately I had the opportunity of
being present at an assembly of our Mullahs, and what I there heard was
enough to make me shudder when I thought what such influential men
among the Muhammadan population might accomplish, even against Akbar,
if supported by ambitious nobles and discontented generals, of whom
many may be found in the court of Agra, as well as throughout
Hindustan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Akbar, impatiently, &ldquo;what do your
Mullahs and their followers want? Have they not the fullest liberty to
think and speak as they will, and to make as many proselytes as they
can? Have I ever laid as much as a straw in their path?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied his companion; &ldquo;but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>does not that also call to heaven? Of what value
to them is the liberty which is shared by unbelievers? Here, in your
court, in the army, and in every kind of employment, are they offended
by the defiling presence of the <i>kafirs</i>. And where is the
vindication of the true faith, to which, above all men on earth, the
Emperor is called, as the representative of Allah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Akbar; &ldquo;here is again the old story,
your people alone are entrusted with the truth, and before that all
must give way, even I; and he who will not bend must break. But why
should you alone be in possession of the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the Prophet, blessed be his name, &ldquo;has himself
declared it to us, and because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; interrupted Akbar, &ldquo;because he, and no
one else, is good. Yes; we have the Padres, who come from the West,
from the land of the Franks: brave, honourable men, as yourselves. They
also have a Prophet, who, if I mistake not, they honour as their God. I
do not clearly understand it; but, in any case, their faith is older
than that of Muhammad. Then there are the Jews, who are not content
with this or that, but hold by Moses alone; and then what do you say to
our Brahmans? They have ancient books which merit the greatest
reverence,&mdash;so venerable that they themselves can scarcely
understand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>them; so ancient, that Moses with his Thora,
Christ with his Evangelist, and Muhammad with his Koran are all new in
comparison. And now I ask you, from your conscience, how can I, a
simple man, who has heard somewhat of all this, but not a hundredth
part of the whole,&mdash;how can I make myself judge amongst these
various faiths, and decide, for example, whether that of Christ or
Muhammad is the true one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were brought up in the teaching of Islam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No very satisfactory foundation for any one&rsquo;s faith. A
sure foundation should rest on conviction brought about by one&rsquo;s
own inquiries, and should hardly depend on the will of one&rsquo;s
father. But the question now is not what I personally
believe&mdash;that concerns no one&mdash;but how I, as prince and ruler
over the kingdom of the Mughals, should conduct myself towards the
professors of the various religious sects who alike are subject to my
rule, and who alike have a claim to my protection. And this question,
best of friends, believe me, you will never answer as long as you only
look at it from one side and not the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, then, the dangers that threaten your kingdom and
throne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have others to think of,&rdquo; replied the Emperor, with a
contemptuous smile, &ldquo;than those <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>with which the anger of
your religious fanatics threaten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others!&rdquo; said Abdul Kadir, looking earnestly at the
Prince. &ldquo;Just so; you mean the kind of dangers caused by
strangers. But what of those dangers, at present secret, but which may
become open, and may find support in your own house, encouraged by
those of your own race? If your son&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son Salim!&rdquo; exclaimed Akbar; &ldquo;and yet,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;that is not impossible. Among the reigning houses
around us, how many, through family feuds, have been subjected to our
rule? And so you mean that Salim himself is ready to join these
malcontents against me? for that appears to me what your words point
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, Sire,&rdquo; answered Abdul Kadir; &ldquo;at least,
I mean that his religious zeal might induce him to do so; but I do not
say that this is the case already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is certain,&rdquo; rejoined Akbar, &ldquo;if this
should ever take place, religious zeal will not be Salim&rsquo;s
inducement. He cares far more for fine wines and beautiful women than
for the Koran and the Prophet. But that is no reason that I should not
thank you for the warning. If you had begun with it at first, many
useless words might have been spared. If in the future you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>should
have any more such communications to make, we will thank you for them.
We must be a little on our guard, and keep a look-out on our people
here. But, for the present, farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with a somewhat ironical smile on his lips, the Emperor left
Abdul Kadir to think over the impression that his words might have
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Allah,&rdquo; muttered the follower of the Prophet between
his teeth, &ldquo;I have done a fine thing by naming Salim. I had only
intended to disturb him, and so to render him more pliant to our will;
instead of which I have simply warned him, and instead of helping, we
shall now find him still harder to deal with. Now he knows or suspects
that some of us league ourselves together with his son against him. You
are looked upon as a wise man, Abdul Kadir, and yet you have acted like
a fool. Ah! if the zeal that fills my soul for our holy faith would but
preserve to me the calm that seldom or never forsakes Akbar! What an
advantage that gives him over us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the composure Akbar showed was as real as the other believed
might well have been doubted by any one who had seen him returning to
the palace, buried in thought, and with his eyes fixed on the
ground.</p>
<p>In one of his private apartments a man awaited him, whose presence,
if Abdul Kadir had but known it, would have given him fresh grounds
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>for a violent outbreak. This was Kulluka the
Brahman. He sat in thought, not noticing the splendour around him, nor
the lovely view over the smiling gardens. Still, this was not the first
time he had seen it.</p>
<p>Presently one of the Imperial Guard came to arouse him from his
thoughts, and to conduct him to the Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed a pleasure to see you here again,&rdquo; said
Akbar, affectionately returning the Brahman&rsquo;s greeting,
&ldquo;and I hope you bring me good news from Kashmir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Sire,&rdquo; answered Kulluka, &ldquo;I wish that I
did, or that I could hide from your Majesty, as from others, all the
causes of uneasiness. But the confidence you have placed in me, as well
as the good of my country, oblige me to keep nothing hidden that I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Akbar; &ldquo;the old story over
again. Party feuds and disputes: sons against their fathers; brothers
intriguing against each other, as in old days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But too true,&rdquo; replied Kulluka. &ldquo;After
Nandigupta, the lawful king, had disappeared from the stage, leaving
all in his brother&rsquo;s hands, we believed that order would be
established, and for some time it was so; and the people were content
with the government, although not enthusiastic for it. At any rate,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>there was no thought of further changes, but now
that is no longer the case. The spirit of faction begins to stir up
discontent, and fresh revolutions appear ready to break out. The worst
of all is that we cannot discover where this plot has its origin. The
king&rsquo;s sons, who sooner or later threaten to rise against him,
certainly do not act from their own inspiration; but whence, then, does
it come? That is what we cannot discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be as it will,&rdquo; said the Emperor, decisively.
&ldquo;Whether or not they act independently, the old game seems about
to begin again. And what, if it cannot be stopped in time, will be the
unavoidable consequence? That, as before, the different parties will
take arms, and civil war will destroy your country. On all sides bands
will be formed, who, the less they find within the boundaries of
Kashmir, so much the more will they carry fire and sword among my
people to repay themselves for what they have lost at home. And now I
say, without circumlocution, and once for all, that I will not tolerate
it. My kingdom and my people shall be respected; and if force is
required, whatever trouble or treasure it may cost, I will again
assemble my armies and march to the north to re-establish the peace
that is necessary to the prosperity of my subjects. Better to tear down
and destroy the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>whole robber&rsquo;s nest than allow it to remain,
to the injury of my people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his respect for the Emperor, these proud, defiant words
could not but excite Kulluka&rsquo;s anger, and, though he gave no
reply, the dark colour mounted to his bronzed cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, worthy Kulluka,&rdquo; said Akbar, &ldquo;if what
I have said angers you. But you should know, as well as I myself, that
in so speaking I do not mean the good men among your people, such as
yourself, your present prince, and his ministers, but the miserable
intriguers that will draw down upon you the greatest misfortune, while
they threaten us with the consequences of their turbulence. To guard
against this is my duty, and I well know how to fulfil it. Do all you
can to make my intervention unnecessary, and you may rest assured that
I shall be the last to wish to force it on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I place the fullest confidence in your words,&rdquo; said
Kulluka, &ldquo;and if I could not suppress a feeling of anger, it was
certainly caused as much by the accursed plots laid for our country and
prince as by the threats, for which, I must confess, there is some
occasion. But does treachery alone seek a home in Kashmir? Is it so
impossible that it should also be present at your court, and that among
your own courtiers and relations there may be found <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>those
who conspire against us and against your rule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went, perhaps, too far, and spoke rashly; still, I have my
suspicions, and though I trust they may prove idle, yet I cannot put
them from me. Salim&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, again Salim? Is he also involved in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what else he is concerned I do not know; but some slight
indications have caused me to warn your Majesty. If they are
groundless, so much the better, but to be on one&rsquo;s guard can in
no case do harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that I shall be. For the present, however, all rests on
supposition and assumed possibility. We must neither judge nor act
rashly; but be assured that nothing you have told me shall escape my
closest inquiry. When we meet again the hour for action may have come.
But before you go, I must tell you something that will be personally
interesting to you&mdash;I have just seen and spoken with your
pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, Siddha?&rdquo; exclaimed Kulluka, with astonishment.
&ldquo;And who presented him to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; answered Akbar; &ldquo;I met him in the park,
and guessing who he was, spoke to him. You know, occasionally I like
thus to converse.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he not know that he spoke with the mighty
Emperor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally not; nor did he guess it. Do not tell him; I will
myself enlighten him one day. You want to know what I think of him?
Well, then, I am content with him. He is a fine, honourable young man,
in whom I can trust. Perhaps somewhat imprudent in
what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not said what was not fitting to the
Emperor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Akbar, laughing, &ldquo;if he had known to
whom he was talking. But do not be disturbed. When I made him see that
he spoke a little too freely he blamed himself in a manner that I could
not but accept. Enough: I have said he pleased me, and you know that I
am not wont to decide so favourably respecting those I see for the
first time. Let him only take care that the first good impression
continues. But now other affairs call me, and I will not detain
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a respectful greeting, Kulluka left the apartment. Akbar looked
after him with affection. A man so far separated by rank and station,
religion and nationality, was yet bound to him both by respect and
friendship, and by a faith that could not fail where he had once given
his word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On him, at least, I can reckon,&rdquo; said the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>Emperor
to himself; &ldquo;in him is no deceit.&rdquo; And he was right; but
how many stood far nearer to him, and of whom he could not say the
same! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=

Abdul Kadir Muluk Shah of Badaun was born at that place in 1540. He
studied music, astronomy, and history, and owing to his beautiful voice
he was appointed Court Im&aacute;m for Wednesdays. He was introduced
early in life to Akbar, and was employed to translate Arabic and
Sanskrit works into Persian. He was a fanatical Muhammadan and looked
upon Ab&uacute;-l Fazl as a heretic, though he served under him. But
all references to the minister, in the works of Badauni, are couched in
bitter and sarcastic terms. He wrote a work called
&ldquo;Tarikh-i-Badauni,&rdquo; which is a history from the time of the
Ghaznevides to 1595, the fortieth year of Akbar&rsquo;s reign. The
prevalent tone, in writing of Akbar his benefactor, is one of censure
and disparagement. El Badauni also translated the
&ldquo;Ramayana,&rdquo; part of the &ldquo;Mahabharata,&rdquo; and a
history of Kashmir into Persian. He died in 1615.</p>

<h2 class="main">A New and an Old Acquaintance.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Siddha reached the Mosque at the appointed time, and
had not waited long before he saw the servant approach and sign to him
to follow her. She led him through different side-paths until they
reached a high garden wall, in which there was a small door. She opened
this, and carefully shut it again, after they had entered. A path
thickly bordered with cactuses and other plants led him to a kind of
terrace with orange-trees and fountains, on which the back part of a
small but tasteful house opened; the rest of it being hidden by thickly
growing trees. Siddha&rsquo;s guide led him up a flight of marble steps
and through a gallery to an apartment open to the fresh air, and having
left him she disappeared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>behind the hangings. On a divan was
carelessly stretched a young woman richly clad in the Persian style. No
sooner did she become aware of her visitor&rsquo;s presence than she
arose and came forward to meet and welcome him. At the first moment
Siddha could hardly have told whether she was beautiful or not. Her
features were not regular; but her soft blue eyes, overshadowed with
silken lashes, had an indescribably sweet and friendly expression; and
though she was not tall, her figure, which her closely-fitting robe
showed to perfection, was most perfectly proportioned. But what
particularly struck Siddha was the whiteness of her neck and bosom,
round which a pearl necklace hung; and the rosy tint of her cheeks,
which he had never seen in other women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble lord,&rdquo; she said,&mdash;and if the impression she
had already made on Siddha had been unfavourable, the sweetness of her
voice would at once have won him to her,&mdash;&ldquo;I thank you for
so speedily fulfilling my request. Perhaps it seems a little
indiscreet; but when you hear the reasons, I trust you will not think
harshly of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To refuse such an invitation,&rdquo; answered Siddha,
&ldquo;would indeed have been uncourteous; though I confess I did not
await the time with the impatience I should have done, noble lady, had
I known whom I should meet.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"
href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>Acknowledging this compliment with a slight inclination of her head,
she continued,&mdash;&ldquo;My excuse is, that no personal reason made
me take this step, but the affairs of another, of a friend of mine,
whom I love with all my heart. Some time ago she was forced to fly from
Agra to escape the snares laid for her by powerful persons here, and
sought a refuge in your country, in Kashmir. Now I have a communication
to make to her which may be of great importance; but until now I could
think of no means of sending safely to her, as I do not trust any of
the messengers at my disposal. Then I heard accidentally, it does not
signify how, that you with your former tutor had arrived in Agra, and
that the guru would shortly return. I at once saw that I could not do
better than trust in the honour of a nobleman whose name was well known
to me, and so determined on begging you to ask your friend to undertake
the delivery of my letter, in which I inform my friend of many things
that are only of importance to her; and I trust my request will not
inconvenience you or the worthy Kulluka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, Siddha&rsquo;s first feeling was one of relief. So,
then, the whole affair merely consisted in taking charge of an
apparently innocent letter, and which, at any rate, did not concern
him. But with his satisfaction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"
href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>was mingled a certain degree of
disappointment, and that there should be no shadow of an adventure in
this affair was not flattering to his vanity. He hastened to assure her
he would gladly charge his tutor with the letter, who would willingly
undertake to convey it.</p>
<p>At a sign from the lady the servant appeared, bringing her a paper
folded in the form of a letter, and fastened with a silken cord,
bearing a seal. &ldquo;The direction, as you see,&rdquo; she said, as
the servant left the room, &ldquo;is not to my friend, but to some one
whom perhaps you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Siddha, &ldquo;we have often
hunted together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will deliver the letter, and so your friend Kulluka will
not know who the real recipient is; for I think it is better that as
few as possible should share the secret. I hope,&rdquo; she continued,
after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;that my friend will profit by
what I tell her. Indeed I pity her greatly in her banishment, though at
times I almost envy her the opportunity she enjoys of visiting your
beautiful country, of which I have read such glowing descriptions. But
tell me frankly, are not these descriptions a little
exaggerated&mdash;at least, they are rather poetical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; answered Siddha, &ldquo;though my tutor has
always warned me against exaggeration as outstepping the bounds of
reality and good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>taste, still I must say the descriptions you
mention fall far beneath the truth. Here nature has her beauties.
Charming are the borders of your Jamuna, and with the magnificence and
luxury of your palaces there is nothing in our northern land that can
be compared; but the beauty of our mountains, woods, and valleys, can
hardly be imagined by you, accustomed to less-favoured lands.&rdquo;
And led away by recollections of his native land, and by the interest
shown by his new and really beautiful listener, our Siddha lost himself
in descriptions of Hindustan&rsquo;s world-famed paradise. His
eloquence, as well as his good looks, increased the admiration with
which his hearer regarded the handsome and powerful youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I detain you too long,&rdquo; she said, at last rising,
&ldquo;and am taking advantage of your kindness. Still, one more
request: let our interview, for the sake of my friend, remain a secret
between you and me. This short meeting can be of no
importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, certainly not,&rdquo; said Siddha; &ldquo;but for me
more than you seem to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she replied, laughing, &ldquo;that you Hindus
are as well versed as our people in the art of paying compliments. But
let us leave that. There still remains something that I should say. I
should show myself indeed unworthy of your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>confidence, if, knowing who you are, I should
myself remain unknown; and, under the promise of secrecy, I see no
reason for withholding my name and rank, lowly as it is. My name is
Rezia; my father, an Armenian, came here for commerce, and early
married me to a merchant of this town, who was already far advanced in
years. Some time ago he went to Persia on his affairs, and perhaps
further; but it is long since I have heard anything of him. In the
meantime I live here, as you see, solitary and quiet, enjoying the
pleasure of a peaceful life. So now you know who you have had the
trouble of visiting, although we may never meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why, noble Rezia, should that not be?&rdquo; asked
Siddha. &ldquo;I see no reason against it, and possibly I may have
things to tell you of the country where your friend now is, that might
interest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Rezia, &ldquo;I will not refuse your
friendship; and if some evening you should have an idle hour, I would
gladly hear tidings of my letter, and that its charge occasioned no
trouble. At any rate, I am sure it has a good chance. No doubt you will
meet my servant, and have only to tell her when you will visit me in my
solitary dwelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the opportunity of seeing you again, I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>shall indeed be grateful,&rdquo; said Siddha, as
he carefully placed the letter entrusted to him in his girdle, and
prepared for the moment to say farewell.</p>
<p>When he reached his home he stood for some time in the verandah,
busied with thought, gazing on the river that flowed softly below him.
Those were the same waters that would bathe the walls of Allahabad
fortress, and reflect back the lovely features of Iravati; true, might
it not be that the waves would take a greeting to his loving betrothed,
and whisper words of love and faith? And he snatched Iravati&rsquo;s
portrait from the wall, and pressing his lips to her image, he seated
himself in the gallery; and as he gazed on her, lovelier than ever
seemed the features of the noble and beautiful Hindu girl. But as his
eyes wandered over the palace and gardens bordering the river,
another&rsquo;s figure appeared before him&mdash;the graceful form, the
blue eyes, and sweet voice of Rezia the Armenian. What was she to him?
Nothing, certainly; but what harm was there even if he found her
charming? He had never promised Iravati that for her sake every other
woman should appear to him both ugly and unpleasing.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; was heard next morning in the courtyard of
Siddha&rsquo;s dwelling. &ldquo;Is your <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>master awake? Go and
see if a visit from me will disturb him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Vatsa could obey the command, Siddha, who was preparing to go
out, recognised the cheerful voice of Parviz, Ab&uacute;-l Fazl&rsquo;s
nephew; and hastened to meet and beg him to come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you on service now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well. Then perhaps you will come with me for an
expedition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very willingly. Where shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Fathp&uacute;r Sikri,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2025src"
href="#xd20e2025" name="xd20e2025src">1</a> the country residence of
the Emperor, the place everyone visits when they first make an
expedition in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I submit myself entirely to your friendly guidance,&rdquo;
answered Siddha; &ldquo;but excuse me if I leave you for a few moments
to say farewell to Kulluka, who is on the point of starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found his tutor in all the hurry of departure, and, as he said
farewell, entrusted him with the letter, which Kulluka took without any
questions. And before long Siddha and Parviz were mounted and, followed
by their servants, on their way out of the town. Their journey was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>nothing but a pleasant ride, their road lying as
it did through an avenue overshadowed with fine trees, with beautiful
views on each side, over fields and shady groves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Parviz, after they had ridden for some time;
&ldquo;such avenues the Emperor has had planted almost everywhere; and
in places where formerly no green leaf was to be seen, and men died of
heat, now these shady roads are to be found. Is not this a great and
useful work? Certainly every traveller has good cause of gratitude to
Akbar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, the Emperor does great things,&rdquo; answered
Siddha&mdash;and his thoughts turned to the extraordinary man with
whom, yesterday, he had talked of Akbar. And he described to Parviz his
strange meeting, and asked if he knew who the person he described could
be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know him not,&rdquo; said Parviz, with difficulty
suppressing a smile; &ldquo;but perhaps you will meet him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; answered Siddha, &ldquo;But, tell me, how
is it that here there are so many people without beards? I always
supposed that your Muhammadans thought a great deal of their
beards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they do; but Akbar thinks quite differently. A little
moustache, like yours and mine, he can put up with, but would rather
see nothing at all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>on one&rsquo;s face. The wisest men have
their whims, and this may be one. Or he may do it with intention to vex
the faithful, and to show them how little he thinks of their opinions
and customs. But, whatever the reason, so it is; and, unimportant and
childish as it seems, this has given rise to much talk and much that is
disagreeable. Now we are approaching the dwelling of one of the chiefs
of the village of this district, who I know very well, through my uncle
the Minister. Shall we rest with him for a few moments while our horses
are watered? My bay is much in want of it, for he was waiting saddled
long before I was ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agreeing to this proposal they dismounted in the inner court of a
farmhouse built of stone and wood, and surrounded by tamarinds and
acacias. The proprietor himself soon appeared&mdash;a middle-aged,
respectable-looking Hindu, with a magisterial air. After the usual
greetings, and while fresh fruit and ice-cold water was brought for
their refreshment, the conversation naturally turned to agriculture and
the great prosperity of the district, although but lately brought under
cultivation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly, of course,&rdquo; said the chief of the village,
&ldquo;we owe the fortunate condition in which we find ourselves to our
own labour and exertion; but we owe great thanks to the Emperor, whose
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>wise and beneficent system of ruling first gave
us the opportunity of using our own strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of his system,&rdquo; remarked Siddha;
&ldquo;still, to tell you the truth, I am scarcely master of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it is very simple,&rdquo; replied the Hindu, &ldquo;and,
to one like you, very easy to comprehend. The system rests principally
on a wise division of the land, and a just settlement of the taxes on
land, and, above all, on the certainty of law and justice, possessed
equally by proprietor and tenant. Everything used to depend on
arbitrary decisions, and no one knew what he might keep or what he
would be obliged to pay; and we chiefs of the villages had to decide
what the yearly taxation of the fields should be. Now that is all
changed: the fields are correctly measured, their boundaries fixed, and
the taxation regulated with reference to their productiveness,
according to which they are placed in classes, and rented for a certain
number of years.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2057src" href="#xd20e2057"
name="xd20e2057src">2</a> And what, perhaps, is the most important
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>of all, the taxes are payable either in money or
in kind; and no Government officer can decide as he will, when disputes
arise, but by the law alone. The consequence of all this is, that the
cultivator, proprietor, or farmer can tell beforehand what land will
cost, what he will have to pay, and what will remain his own property.
Is it any wonder, then, that he now, understanding his affairs, applies
all his energies to them, and becomes prosperous, whereas before he was
content if he could but earn his daily rice. You see the fruits of the
system around you, and can form your own opinion; but you could do so
far better if you had known the former condition of the country as I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same system in any country would lead to the same
results,&rdquo; answered Siddha. &ldquo;What <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>a
blessing for a state to possess a prince like Akbar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must also be grateful to his councillors,&rdquo; said the
magistrate, <span class="corr" id="xd20e2099" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>particularly to Todar Mal,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2102src" href="#xd20e2102" name="xd20e2102src">3</a>
the treasurer, who worked out the system; and to Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, the
great Wazir, who put the last touch to the work, and repressed with
severity the extortions of the Government officers. If in the beginning
these measures appeared to diminish the revenues of the state, in the
long run it has been quite the contrary; but had the revenues been
lessened, still they would have been far more productive, because the
payments are certain and punctual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, worthy sir,&rdquo; asked Siddha, &ldquo;is there not
danger of these excellent regulations falling to the ground if a less
wise prince should ascend the throne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;No despot
could easily take from our community such rights when it had once
obtained them. You know that our people almost entirely govern
themselves by their magistrates, and are thus, to a certain extent,
independent of the sovereign. If he attempted to deprive them of their
rights he would find that he must wage war against a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>dozen small states, and would not find soldiers
enough to reduce them all to obedience. Even should he succeed in doing
so, the villages would be almost entirely deserted, and the population
would seek refuge in impenetrable jungles and wildernesses. On the
other hand, our villagers leave the prince free to act as he will. He
can carry on war against other kingdoms as much as he pleases, and as
long as the state of his treasury admits; and they never concern
themselves with court intrigues and disputes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a happy condition of things,&rdquo; said Siddha,
&ldquo;for both parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the union of state and people is not much advanced by
it,&rdquo; remarked Parviz, joining in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is true,&rdquo; answered the magistrate. &ldquo;But
do you believe it possible that there can be real unity in a State such
as our present Hindustan, where so many and such different races and
people are brought together under one rule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I acknowledge that it may be difficult; still, it is worth
trying for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation, which was very interesting to Siddha, continued
for some time, and then the two friends, taking leave, mounted their
horses and continued their journey. A brisk but rather long ride, which
obliged them more than once to halt and rest, brought them in sight of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>heights on which the palace of Fathp&uacute;r
was built. However striking had been the first view of the palaces of
Agra, this was not less so. The buildings rising one above another, as
though built on terraces, stood out proud and stately against the sky,
with their tall towers, and sharply cut battlements. Broad marble steps
glittered in the sunshine, here and there overshadowed by the thick
green of tamarinds and other trees.</p>
<p>As Siddha and his companion, leaving their horses to the charge of
their servants, entered the precincts of the palace itself, the former,
though less astonished, was far more delighted than he had been with
his first view of Agra. The gardens pleased him more, and were more
satisfying to the eye, for here no wrong was done to nature; the paths,
instead of being laid out with uniform regularity, followed the
unevenness of the ground, and were thickly overshadowed by luxuriant
vegetation. And what a magnificent and refreshing view over the
neighbouring hills and fields, rich and golden with corn, and over the
silver shining river! For some time the two wandered about, sometimes
through solitary groves, and then through galleries filled with guards
and servants. At last Parviz proposed they should go to the lower town
to seek their lodgings, and to obtain better refreshment than had been
possible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>on the road. This proposal was willingly agreed
to; and after the two friends had enjoyed the needful repose, they
again sallied out to visit what was to be seen in the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Parviz, &ldquo;if I leave you for a
few minutes. I have to give some papers from my uncle to one of his
officers here, and to speak to him about some affairs which will not
interest you. He lives close by, and I shall be back immediately. In
the meantime you can visit that old temple yonder, surrounded with
acacias; or, if you like it better, pay your devotions
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much obliged,&rdquo; he answered, laughing; &ldquo;I
scarcely care to do that, but I will willingly visit the temple, and
will await you close by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Siddha had hardly entered the vaulted, dimly-lit building before he
recognised it as a temple of Siva by the numerous emblematic ornaments
on the pillars, and, advancing a few steps, he saw at the furthest end
a kind of hall lighted from above, where was placed a colossal image of
the god, seated cross-legged on a lotus, his arms and ancles ornamented
with numberless rings, the symbol of the trinity on his forehead, and a
necklace of skulls around his neck. Siva was the immortal ruler of the
world, creating to destroy, and destroying to create afresh, endless in
his manifestation and transformation of being, from whence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>all
takes origin, and to which everything must return. Well as our young
Indian understood the idea represented by these images and their
symbols, the mis-shapen, monstrous figures struck him with the same
feeling of repulsion as they had done when he first beheld them. The
temple itself was not wanting in beauty, though disfigured by the
grotesque representations on the walls.</p>
<p>He had not been long alone before he heard a voice behind him,
although the silence was unbroken by any sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Om,&rdquo; sounded through the stillness; &ldquo;Om, the
unworthy servant of Siva&rsquo;s holy consort greets thee, O Moral
Force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the spot from whence came the voice, Siddha recognised
the Durga priest Gorakh, whom he had seen in company with his uncle at
Allahabad. &ldquo;I greet you, holy man,&rdquo; he said, and awaited
what the other should say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, then, we have not forgotten each other since our last
meeting,&rdquo; replied the priest. &ldquo;In truth I have not lost
sight of you since I saw you in the neighbourhood of
Badrinath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that be as it will,&rdquo; answered Siddha, half
impatiently; &ldquo;but I scarcely comprehend, honoured lord, why you
should concern yourself about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should not,&rdquo; asked the other, &ldquo;the nephew of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>my old friend and pupil have claim to the
interest I feel in him? and for that reason I feel obliged to give you
a warning, if you will take it from me. You know who Gurupada the
hermit is, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gurupada?&rdquo; asked Siddha. &ldquo;Certainly; he is a
hermit living in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I mean who he was before he assumed his present
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that I know nothing&mdash;he never alluded to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your guru, Kulluka, must have told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never asked him; it was nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gorakh turned a penetrating look towards the speaker; but he would
have been no true Indian had his countenance displayed ought but utter
indifference. However, irritated by the persistence of his questioner,
he proceeded, with less caution, to say, &ldquo;Even if I knew who and
what Gurupada had been, can you not understand that I would not tell
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried the Yogi, &ldquo;you mean you do not trust
me. You mean to defy me. Do you remember that I am a friend of the
Governor of Allahabad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that,&rdquo; said Siddha, expressing
vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I know, and that is enough.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>The priest regarded Siddha with anger, not unmingled with
disquietude. What was the meaning of this tone, and what could he
really know? Still for the moment the wisest course seemed to be to
break off the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, then,&rdquo; said Gorakh, &ldquo;both for you and for
me; but bethink yourself, my young friend&mdash;though you are so
little desirous of my friendship, and I will not force it on
you,&mdash;think that the mighty goddess, to whose service all my
feeble strength is devoted, not only protects but destroys also, and
that there is no hope of mercy or chance of salvation for him whom,
through her priests, she has chosen out for her service and who has
turned from it.&rdquo; So saying, he disappeared down a side aisle,
without waiting for any answer to his mysterious menace. Siddha looked
after him with an involuntary feeling of anxiety; and though in reality
the Durga priest was alone, yet he almost fancied he could see him
followed by a long train of naked bronze figures, with white cords
round their necks, just as he had seen him in the dimness of night
passing along the wall of Allahabad fortress and vanishing in the
jungle. And that night, as he went to rest, he thought it would be as
well to question his faithful servant who awaited his orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vatsa,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at Allahabad you assured me
that neither you nor Kulluka&rsquo;s servant had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>spoken to any priest or penitent; but can you
not remember some other unknown person to whom you might have talked of
our journey through the mountains, and recounted to him some of its
incidents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never have thought of it again, Sir, if you had not
brought it to my mind,&rdquo; replied Vatsa; &ldquo;but now I remember
that near the stable a half-naked, bronze-coloured man once talked with
us, and told us much about the town and fortress, and then asked us
about our journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you told him of my adventure with Gurupada&rsquo;s
tiger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you say anything of the hermit and his
appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Vatsa. &ldquo;His venerable and
princely bearing had so struck us that we were full of it, and not
thinking there was any harm in speaking of it we made no secret of our
meeting with him to the stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you describe Gurupada&rsquo;s appearance
exactly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot distinctly remember all we said; but I believe we
did speak of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is danger,&rdquo; murmured Siddha to himself,
&ldquo;and more than danger. The priest naturally learnt enough from
his spy about our journey to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>put me out of countenance. His
suspicions seem to be aroused as regards Gurupada; and it is clear he
tried to find out more from me. But what can he have to do with
Gurupada or Nandigupta? And my uncle Salhana&mdash;is he also mixed up
in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we have done no harm by our talk with the
stranger,&rdquo; said Vatsa, disquieted by seeing his young master sunk
in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and even had you done so,
it was done unintentionally, and you are not to blame. We ought to have
been more cautious, and to have warned you beforehand. But in future,
Vatsa, do not speak to any one of the hermit, whoever it may be that
asks you; do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, my lord,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;and in
future I have never seen the hermit, or even if I have done so, I have
entirely forgotten what he was like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; thought Siddha, &ldquo;it might be as
well to warn Kulluka, and even Nandigupta himself. I will try and find
a safe opportunity, whether Salhana has anything to do with it, or
not.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=

Fathp&uacute;r Sikri was the favourite residence of Akbar from 1570 to
the end of his reign. The chief glory of the place is its mosque.
Fathp&uacute;r Sikri is 12 miles from Agra.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

Akbar&rsquo;s system is fully described by Ab&uacute;-l Fazl in the
&ldquo;A&rsquo;&iacute;n-i-Akbari.&rdquo; The lands were divided into
four classes with different revenue to be paid by each,
namely:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. <i>Pulaj</i>, cultivated every harvest and never fallow.</li>
<li>2. <i>Paranti</i>, lying fallow at intervals.</li>
<li>3. <i>Checher</i>, fallow for four years together.</li>
<li>4. <i>Bunjar</i>, not cultivated for five years and upwards.</li>
</ul>
<p class="footnote">The lands of the two first of these classes were
divided into best, middling, and bad. The produce of a
<i>b&iacute;gah</i> of each sort was added together, and a third of
that was considered to be the average produce. One third of this
average was the share of the State, as settled by Akbar&rsquo;s
assessment. Remissions were made on the two last classes of land. The
Government demand might be paid either in money or kind. The settlement
was made for ten years.</p>
<p class="footnote">In Akbar&rsquo;s reign the land revenue yielded
&pound;16,582,440, and the revenue from all sources was
&pound;32,000,000. Akbar also remitted many vexatious imposts,
including the poll tax on unbelievers, the tax on pilgrims, ferry dues,
and taxes on cattle, trees, trade licenses, and market dues on many
articles.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Form quickly,&rdquo; said the commandant of the
Rajp&uacute;ts, as he stood in the court of the fortress, while the
cavalry fell into rank; &ldquo;and then march for the field where the
Emperor reviews the troops to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This order was obeyed without delay, and, when outside the
fortification, they broke into a trot, until they reached a plain, at
some little distance from the town, where the review was to be held. A
splendid sight lay stretched out before Siddha, as, at the head of his
detachment, he ascended a small hill. On the right was a whole town, as
it were, of tents; long, broad streets, laid out with the utmost
regularity. In the middle stood the imperial tent, made of red cloth,
with a gilded dome-shaped roof,&mdash;if one might call a palace of
cloth and wood a tent; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>and on the left, brilliant with
many colours, were drawn up the different army corps&mdash;some
horsemen in armour and some without, some armed with lances and some
with guns; and there stood the artillery and war elephants; and further
off, other elephants with luxurious <i>hauda</i>, on whose cushions
were seated ladies, most of them veiled, who had come to see the
spectacle.</p>
<p>Soon after the arrival of the Rajp&uacute;ts the troops moved
forward, and, preceded by their bands, defiled before the Emperor and
his staff. Siddha did not hesitate long before deciding which was the
Emperor among that brilliant group of officers, their arms and
horse-trappings glittering with gold and jewels. <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e2225" title="Source: Unmistakeable">Unmistakable</span> was his
whole bearing&mdash;a robust man on a splendid white horse, with the
commander&rsquo;s staff in his hand, standing a few steps in advance of
the others, his standard and umbrella bearer behind him. Instantly
Siddha recognised in the mighty ruler the man with whom he had spoken
in the gardens of the palace, a suspicion of whose real rank had for a
moment crossed his mind.</p>
<p>When his turn came to pass before the Emperor with his men, he bent
his head and pointed his lance to the ground, as he had seen others do;
and stealing a glance at the Emperor, saw a smile pass over his stern
features, from which he gathered that Akbar had not taken ill his bold
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>words, and he remembered that excepting a
passing outburst of anger, his interlocutor had maintained during the
whole interview a frank and friendly tone. He came to the conclusion
that he had no cause to dread his presentation to the Emperor, which
Faizi had warned him would most likely take place after the review.
This expectation was soon fulfilled. No sooner had the halt been
sounded, a sign that the troops might for a time repose, than Siddha
saw Faizi beckon, and on joining him he was guided through tents, the
magnificence of which rivalled that of the palace itself; and a few
minutes later he found himself in presence of the Emperor. Faizi was
not a little surprised at seeing Akbar, without waiting for the
official presentation, step forward to meet Siddha, replying to his
reverential greeting with a gracious movement of his hand, and say,
&ldquo;Well, I saw you at the head of your troop, and it seems to me
that you will turn out a good officer. Take care that my expectations
are fulfilled. I have already made acquaintance with your
friend,&rdquo; he continued, turning to Faizi; &ldquo;we met a few days
ago, although at the time he had no idea who I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even had I known it, Sire,&rdquo; said Siddha, respectfully,
&ldquo;I could not have regarded your Majesty with more reverence than
I did the unknown stranger.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119"
href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps spoken a little less freely,&rdquo; said Akbar,
smiling. &ldquo;However, there is no harm done, and I had far rather
hear what men think of me than guess what they say behind my back. Our
former meeting induces me to command, or rather to request, for what I
wish cannot be forced, that now you know me, you will trust me as you
did when I was a stranger. You see to-day that your confidence was not
misplaced. Turn to me, and not to others, when you think that you have
cause of complaint against me or mine. I never refuse to hear
grievances: if they are groundless I try to refute them; if real, to
redress them. Boldness and free speaking, my friend Faizi here can bear
witness, never arouse my anger, however much dissimulation and
falsehood may do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some questions and replies regarding the particulars of
Siddha&rsquo;s service, the Emperor signified that the audience was at
an end, and they took their leave, Faizi not a little bewildered about
this first meeting, a full account of which his young companion soon
gave him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are indeed a child of fortune,&rdquo; said Faizi;
&ldquo;such things do not happen to every one, however easy of access
Akbar is, and however willingly he enters into conversation. You seem
to have made a favourable impression on him, and that rejoices me from
my heart. But do I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span>not see Parviz approaching? Yes, indeed;
but what can he be doing here? Well,&rdquo; continued he to his nephew,
&ldquo;what is my lord the future councillor doing here among warriors
in their tents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as my worthy uncle the philosopher,&rdquo; answered
Parviz; &ldquo;but I willingly confess that I can rival him as little
in statecraft and learning as in deeds of arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No compliments, my nephew,&rdquo; answered the other,
laughing; &ldquo;they are not fitting between us. But shall I tell you
my suspicions? That you have come to have a glance at those beautifully
decorated elephants yonder: the lovely daughter of Todar Mal is perhaps
not unaccustomed to your appearance, although you are supposed never to
have seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle, now in my turn I say, no betrayal of my secrets!
However,&rdquo; added Parviz, good-naturedly, &ldquo;I have none from
my friend Siddha, and all the more, that I am sure of his sympathy
whenever he thinks of his no less dearly loved betrothed, though I am
less fortunate than he; and even if I hope to find favour in the eyes
of the daughter, I am not so sure of doing so in those of the
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will all come right in time,&rdquo; remarked Faizi,
good-naturedly; &ldquo;but enough at present of our confidences. See,
here come others, for whose ears they are not intended.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked Siddha, as he saw a group of
horsemen approach, in the centre of which rode a young man but a few
years older than himself, and whose appearance for more than one reason
attracted his attention. He was dressed with the most luxurious
splendour: over his coat of gold cloth he wore no less than four
necklaces of pearls of unwonted size; his turban was ornamented by a
heron&rsquo;s feather and three jewels of priceless worth. On his arms,
up to the elbows, were clasped numerous bracelets, all set with
precious stones; and on each finger was a ring; while his weapons and
horse-trappings were a mass of pearls and diamonds. But in strange
contrast to all this splendour was the wearied white face, its
sallowness still more marked by the jet-black eyes and finely pencilled
moustache and eyebrows. Originally the features must have been noble
and beautiful, but they were ruined and aged before their time, and
bore signs of many a night spent in dissipation and riot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, do you not know him?&rdquo; answered Faizi; &ldquo;that
is Salim, the Emperor&rsquo;s son and heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a silent greeting the Prince was about to ride by, but a sudden
thought striking him, he drew in his horse by Faizi, and said,
&ldquo;Sirs, I am glad to meet you here; I expect some friends this
evening in my palace to a feast, will you also give me the pleasure of
your presence?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The invitation,&rdquo; answered Faizi, &ldquo;would be to me
a command, if a still higher one did not prevent me from obeying: the
Emperor has invited me for this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you will give my father another lesson from your
unbelieving philosophers; is it not so?&rdquo; said Salim, with a
half-contemptuous smile, not quite pleased with the refusal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I myself may do,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;can
depend on the will of your Highness; but what the Emperor may think
good to do is, it appears to me, above your opinion and above mine.
Also there may be a question as to which evening will be most
profitably spent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do not be angry, noble Faizi,&rdquo; said Salim,
good-naturedly. &ldquo;I mean no harm; and if I leave your evening
alone, let me have mine. And you, Parviz,&rdquo; said he, turning to
him, &ldquo;have you also some important business to prevent your
enjoying some innocent amusement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; answered Parviz, &ldquo;and even if I
had, I would desire nothing better than to thrust it on one side before
the pleasure of a feast in Salim&rsquo;s palace. But allow me, if it is
not indiscreet, to present to your Highness a new friend of
mine.&rdquo; And signing to Siddha to approach, he announced his name
and rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Salim, &ldquo;I remember hearing of his
arrival; and if you,&rdquo; he continued, turning to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>Siddha, &ldquo;will accompany your friend this
evening, it will give me pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be both honour and pleasure to me,&rdquo; said
Siddha, bowing respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not much honour in it,&rdquo; said Salim, &ldquo;I
am of no consequence at this court; still I hope that our meeting may
give you pleasure. Till this evening, then.&rdquo; And turning his
horse the Prince rode off, followed by his retinue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And allow me also, honoured friend,&rdquo; said Siddha,
&ldquo;to take my leave; it is time that I should return to my
troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will,&rdquo; said Parviz, &ldquo;come and fetch me
this evening; my dwelling is on the way, and we can go
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; answered the other, as he turned away
to return to his post.</p>
<p>Though Siddha had anticipated that Salim&rsquo;s palace would be one
of great splendour, yet his expectations were far outstripped by the
unheard-of luxury which surrounded him on all sides, as he passed
through different ante-rooms and rows of servants, before reaching the
brilliantly lighted hall where the Prince welcomed his friends. In
spite of the richness of the imperial palace, there was something grave
and sober about it; but here, on the contrary, in the midst of Moorish
architecture and sparkling decoration, all breathed of luxury and the
search after boundless enjoyment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"
href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>Many coloured hangings of
silk and gold hung from the finely cut arches, and the marble walls
were partly covered with variegated mosaic work and gilding; thick
masses of flowers spread fragrance around; broad mirrors reflected back
the light, while the foot sank deep in soft carpets of fantastic
designs; luxurious divans wooed the passer-by to repose; and there at
his hand were drinking-cups of open-worked gold and crystal, and
porphyry and marble coolers of every form. On one side of the hall was
a kind of stage, lighted with coloured lamps, where dancers and players
were to perform. All this formed a picture that at first sight would
strike the beholder with surprise, however accustomed he might be to
the palaces of India.</p>
<p>Salim quickly caught sight of the new comers among the other guests,
who stood talking in groups, while others reclined on divans, and
advancing towards them, he said, &ldquo;You are right welcome to my
humble dwelling, and I hope that this evening will afford you
enjoyment; but let me tell you that etiquette has nothing to do with
pleasure, and here we are all friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince turned away, and at the same moment Siddha saw approach a
well-known but unexpected figure&mdash;that of Salhana, Governor of
Allahabad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nephew,&rdquo; he said, giving him his hand, &ldquo;I
am very glad to meet you here; I have just <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>arrived, and found an invitation from the Prince
awaiting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how goes all yonder?&rdquo; asked Siddha; &ldquo;and how
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iravati,&rdquo; interrupted Salhana. &ldquo;Very well; she
sends her greetings. But see, there comes a man whose acquaintance you
must make; he is not much seen at court, but, for all that, is a man
well worth knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No introduction was necessary, for the man was no other than Abdul
Kadir, Badaoni, the Islam fanatic, whom Siddha had already met in the
imperial park with Akbar. To his astonishment this man greeted his
uncle with courtesy, although he was an unbeliever like himself; and
even to his share fell a recognition which could not be considered
uncourteous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already met your nephew accidentally,&rdquo; said
Abdul Kadir, as Salhana was about to introduce him; &ldquo;and I
hope,&rdquo; he continued to Siddha, &ldquo;that you regard the words I
then spoke in the sense I gave them, for you see now that persons are
not hated by me, however much I combat the false doctrines they
hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I honour your feelings, noble Sir,&rdquo; said Siddha,
&ldquo;although I regret that you are not one with us;
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps what?&rdquo; began Abdul Kadir, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my friends,&rdquo; interposed Salhana; &ldquo;no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>disputes, I pray, over your different beliefs.
Think rather of the grave dangers which threaten us all, we Hindus as
well as you true sons of the Prophet, should the plans be carried out
in true earnest that the higher powers now think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some others, apparently trusted acquaintances of Salhana and the
Muhammadan, had joined the speakers, forming a thick ring around them,
while Parviz and some young friends had gone to the other end of the
hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us consider,&rdquo; continued Salhana, in a low but
audible voice, &ldquo;how we should bear ourselves should our otherwise
honoured Emperor attempt, as is probable, to force upon us a religion
alike abhorrent to our feelings, customs, and morals. Will you
Muhammadans, the present rulers of the land, deny Allah, and kneel in
adoration before the sun and stars, and
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the beard of the Prophet,&rdquo; began Abdul Kadir, laying
his hand on the hilt of his sword, &ldquo;we
should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that be as it may,&rdquo; interrupted the other;
&ldquo;there are still worse things. Consider the words
&lsquo;All&aacute;hu Akbar&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2322src"
href="#xd20e2322" name="xd20e2322src">1</a> we now find on our coins
and firmans; they are innocent enough if you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>understand them as &lsquo;God is great,&rsquo;
but far different if you read them in the sense of &lsquo;Akbar is
God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes indeed too far,&rdquo; broke out Abdul Kadir, in
bitter anger.</p>
<p>But Salhana again interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be calm,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we have at present
only to do with suppositions, which may, as I hope, turn out to be
groundless. But should it be so, could you, and would you,
submit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This question was addressed as much to those standing around as to
Abdul Kadir, and made a deep impression on Siddha. That Akbar had
thought of founding a new religion had already come to his ears; but
could it be that he thought of using force as an aid to conversion; was
this possible?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; concluded Salhana, &ldquo;let there be no
division between us; let us consider together, and by unanimity and the
use of legitimate measures we may ward off the dangers that threaten
us, through the excited imagination of an otherwise excellent sovereign
being worked on by fanatics and intriguers. But I believe that the
Prince already signs to us that the feast is about to begin. Let us for
the moment break off our conversation; I shall remain at your command,
my lords. Perhaps I am in error; from my heart I wish that it may turn
out so.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the guests were taking their places on the divans, Siddha heard,
in passing one of the groups of talkers, a few words that attracted his
attention&mdash;&ldquo;And Kashmir,&rdquo; asked one of the speakers;
&ldquo;is she informed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoroughly,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;the mine is almost
ready to be sprung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is in the best of hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other guests divided Siddha from the two whose conversation he had
accidentally heard, and he was soon seated, not far from Salhana, but
divided from him by several young people, with whom he was soon in
conversation; while servants carried round various refreshments, and
rich wines flowed in the golden drinking-cups. Now and then the words
he had heard crossed his mind, but their meaning was dark. Could they
refer to secret divisions in his native land, which, according to
Salhana were stirred up by Akbar. And the letter! Involuntarily his
thoughts turned to Rezia&rsquo;s letter that he had entrusted to
Kulluka; but what could that have to do with state affairs? His
attention was soon engrossed by the dancers who, accompanied by
musicians, appeared on the stage at the end of the hall. Their
bronze-coloured arms and necks were bare, while a long robe fell to
their feet. To the music of stringed instruments and cymbals, they
commenced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>one of those dances so dear to both Indians and
Muhammadans, and which they can watch unwearied for hours. Now and
then, for a change, their places were taken by singers, who treated
their audience with extracts from the Persian poets, which Salim and
his friends listened to with great pleasure, but which to Siddha
appeared a little monotonous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Rembha,&rdquo; at last asked the Prince, &ldquo;that
she does not come and sing a few translated passages from an old Indian
poem, that you, Siddha, doubtless know well&mdash;I mean the Gita
Govinda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; answered Siddha; &ldquo;the pastoral of
Jayadeva, which describes the adventures of the god Krishna with the
shepherdesses, and his reconciliation with the beautiful Radha. I have
myself attempted a translation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2357src" href="#xd20e2357" name="xd20e2357src">2</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us listen,&rdquo; said Salim; &ldquo;here comes
Rembha.&rdquo; And on the stage appeared a dark but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=

costume; and, accompanied by soft music, she began half to sing, half
to recite, the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poetry and the meaning,&rdquo; said Salim, as the singer
paused, &ldquo;leave nothing to be desired; but what, noble Siddha, do
you think of the translation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;the imagery and spirit
are well and freely given, even if here and there the word are not
exactly followed; but that, I believe, in the poetry of the present
day, would be difficult if not impossible. Is not the name of the
translator known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Faizi, with whom I saw you talking this morning,&rdquo;
said the Prince, smiling at the confusion painted on Siddha&rsquo;s
cheeks at hearing these words and thinking of the rather magisterial
opinion he had just expressed. &ldquo;Do not be disturbed,&rdquo;
continued he; &ldquo;Faizi will not take it ill that you do not
consider his work faultless; but, on the contrary, will be grateful for
any corrections. Now, Rembha, let us hear one piece more, and then for
this evening we will not trouble you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the singer, &ldquo;is the complaint of the
forsaken Radha to her friend:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Ah, my beloved! taken with those

<p class="line">Ah, my beloved! dancing those rash dances;</p>

<p class="line">Ah, Krishna, Krishna, with the honeyed lip!</p>
<p class="line">Ah, wanderer into foolish fellowship!</p>
<p class="line xd20e2438">My dancer, my delight! I love thee still.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=

<div class="lg">

<p class="line">Rise! thou whose forehead is the star of day,</p>

<p class="first">For a short moment Rembha paused, and then continued
in a slightly altered measure, and with a softer and sadder tone in her
sweet voice, as though she from her heart threw herself into the
r&ocirc;le of the loving Radha.</p>

<p>Universal applause greeted the singer as she concluded: the beauty
of the words, so fully expressed by her voice and bearing, came home to
them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then follows the reconciliation of Krishna and Radha, does it
not?&rdquo; said Salim, &ldquo;but that we will have another time. Tell
me, worthy Abdul Kadir,&rdquo; he continued, perhaps not without
intention, &ldquo;does the Hindu poetry give you as much pleasure as
our own, or, like others of the Faithful, have you a horror of the
false ideas proclaimed by these Hindus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With poets,&rdquo; answered Abdul Kadir, with difficulty
suppressing his anger, &ldquo;I have not much to do; and our Holy
Prophet, blessed be his name, cursed with good reason the impious
Amru-l Kais,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2501src" href="#xd20e2501"
name="xd20e2501src">7</a> however highly his <i>Mullakat</i> was famed
by others. But that the Hindus, not content with writing the wanton
poetry we have just heard, should dare to hold up such beings as
Krishna and Radha as objects of worship, appears to me too
gross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Siddha was about to attempt to show <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>the
fanatic that there was a difference between mythology and true worship,
between poetry and faith, Salim hindered further discussion by
saying&mdash;&ldquo;No theology, gentlemen, I beg; let us leave that to
my honoured father, who is, at this moment, I believe, occupied with
the learned Faizi, and, it may be, with other philosophers also; but we
younger ones have met together to pass a merry evening. Ho! you singers
and players! A drinking song, and a gay one too, that may bring back
the right tone amongst us; and let wine flow to rejoice our hearts.
That no anger may linger in your mind, noble Abdul Kadir, think that
even a poet, whom our great Prophet did not curse, and who is honoured
amongst us,&mdash;think that Tarafa<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2514src"
href="#xd20e2514" name="xd20e2514src">8</a> sang:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Wouldst thou spend the livelong day</p>
<p class="line">In the tavern bright and gay,</p>
<p class="line">I with song would mirthfully</p>
<p class="line">Bear thee joyous company.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Ready on the board we&rsquo;ll find,</p>
<p class="line">When the morrow breaks again,</p>
<p class="line">Foaming goblet&mdash;rosy wine&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Which with joy once more we&rsquo;ll drain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">And why should we not follow the good
advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sullen Muhammadan muttered behind his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>beard, but dared say nothing, for he had need of
Salim, as the latter well knew, as an ally in the troubles that might
arise from Akbar&rsquo;s forsaking the faith. He was silent, therefore,
and ended with consoling himself for his wrongs by drinking as deeply
as any, in spite of what the Prophet might have said.</p>
<p>The other guests made good use of their time, and the drinking-cups
were no sooner emptied than they were refilled. Then the singers and
bayadires, at a sign from Salim, mingled in the gay company, and took
their places on the divans amongst them.</p>
<p>The beautiful Rembha seated herself by Siddha, and before long they
were in conversation. He discovered her not only to be accomplished but
good-hearted, from the compassionate manner in which she spoke of the
unfortunate dancers, who, though not slaves in reality, were sold in
their earliest years by their parents to the highest bidders, and then
passed from one to another like so much merchandise, leading a life but
little better than real slavery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And though,&rdquo; she said, frankly, &ldquo;in the beginning
mine was the same fate, fortunately I had a talent for music. My patron
gave me a thorough education in it; and now I can support myself by
means of my art. And when,&rdquo; she continued, smiling, &ldquo;I
become old and ugly, then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; cried Siddha, who had listened with
sympathy to all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; answered Rembha, &ldquo;I know what you mean,
and you forget yourself. When I become old and ugly, I need not descend
to a life of adventure; being a Hindu of high caste, there will be no
difficulty in finding employment in one of the temples to superintend
the dancers and singers kept by the priests for their
ceremonials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the words were interrupted by a wilder and louder burst of
music, and when it ceased other guests and women joined in the talk.
But now the conversation became less guarded, and many an expression
met Siddha&rsquo;s ear that until now was unknown to him, but the
meaning of which he soon caught. By degrees he also began to lose his
sense of decorum. Here and there lay a reveller, still clasping his
empty goblet, and quite unconscious of all around. And there on the
divan were groups whose bearing showed no recollection of the high
presence in which they found themselves.</p>
<p>But the Prince had long ceased to take much notice of what went on
around him; he had thrown himself carelessly back between two dancers,
one of whom played with the hilt of his dagger, while the other
examined the many bracelets on his arms. One of these he unclasped and
flung at her, tossing at the same time two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>costly pearls, he had torn from his coat, to her
companion; then filling high his goblet, he drained it to the last
drop, and sank back senseless on his cushion. And now, as the
conversation became more confused, so also it became louder and louder,
while the music played, and the wine flowed in streams; and our Siddha,
overcome by the noise, and heavy perfume of flowers, and still more
perhaps by the wine, by degrees remarked less and less all that went on
around him. But a heavy hand laid suddenly on his shoulder aroused him
from his stupefaction. It was Salhana, who had approached him
unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is time we departed; on
occasions like these who can tell what quarrels or disputes may break
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Siddha, with hesitating speech;
&ldquo;but can we go before the Prince gives the sign for
leave-taking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince!&rdquo; answered Salhana, contemptuously:
&ldquo;look! and judge whether he is likely to know or care whether we
go or remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced towards Salim, who reclined on a divan with closed eyes,
his arm hanging over the cushion, while a few paces from him lay his
newly-filled goblet that had fallen from his hand and rolled on the
carpet. Though Siddha did his best, he could not see Salim; or, if he
did, it appeared to him there were two Salims; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>without resisting he let his uncle lead him from
the hall, and assist him into a palanquin which awaited them at the
door; and after giving directions to the bearers, Salhana, who had
certainly not drunk less than his nephew, turned, with a firm and
steady tread, towards his dwelling. As he passed through one of the
narrow streets he saw under the shadow of a house a tall thin figure,
which, after looking cautiously around, left its hiding-place and
approached him&mdash;it was Gorakh the Yogi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does all go well?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be better,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Our
cause prospers; I cannot yet give particulars, but when I know more,
and certainly in case we have need of you and your followers, you shall
be warned at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our young simpleton? keep your eye upon him, for I
believe he has suspicions of our understanding. When he is once with us
that will not signify. But tell me, is the bird in the trap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered Salhana; &ldquo;but it will not be
long before he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gorakh laughed, and the men parted, each going his own way.

<p class="first">Faizi&rsquo;s excuse for refusing the Prince&rsquo;s
invitation was no feigned one, for at the moment when Salim&rsquo;s
guests were assembling he was awaiting very different company in the
private apartments of the Emperor. Preceded by a servant a man entered,
by whose garb any one from the West would at once have recognised a
Catholic Priest. It was the Padre Rudolf Aquaviva, head of the Jesuit
Mission, and deputed to the court of Agra by the Father
Provincial.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2589src" href="#xd20e2589" name=

<p>&ldquo;You are welcome, worthy Father,&rdquo; said Akbar, returning
his greeting; &ldquo;welcome in the name of the Great Being whom we
both worship, although in different ways. I hope,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;that the journey has not wearied you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful to your Majesty for the interest you take in
me,&rdquo; answered Aquaviva. &ldquo;Our journey, fortunately, has been
accomplished without accident, although my health is feeble; but it is
fitting that insignificant man should bear, without murmuring, what the
Lord appoints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that I agree with you,&rdquo; said Akbar; &ldquo;but I
have to thank you for the books that in your absence you were so good
as to send me&mdash;your evangelists&rsquo; and other writings. My
friend Faizi here, who doubtless you remember, has translated the
greater part of them for me, and I assure you that we have carefully
read them, together with Ab&uacute;-l Fazl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; asked the Padre, gazing earnestly into
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>the Emperor&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;may we hope
that the seed is fallen in good soil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that I can answer yes,&rdquo; said Akbar.
&ldquo;Some of your holy books I prize very highly, now that I have
made closer acquaintance with them. What beautiful, elevated truth they
contain, and noble ideas, almost beyond our grasp (which, however, are
not entirely wanting in the teaching of Islam). What a noble, pure
conception of self-denial and self-sacrifice, and, above all, what a
pure idea of love and charity! and this is entirely wanting in the
Koran. After this I can hardly tell you how far above Muhammadanism I
place Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord be praised!&rdquo; said the Jesuit, clasping his
hands, and casting his eyes up to heaven. &ldquo;That is the right way;
first error recognised by comparison with truth, then is the soul
steadfast. And how should it be possible that a man like Akbar, who is
not only a powerful prince but a wise and learned scholar, should not
be able to distinguish truth from lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am flattered by your good opinion,&rdquo; said Akbar;
&ldquo;but am afraid I shall fall in it when you hear what I have to
add to the words I have already spoken. Still I must say it, for I wish
to act openly and fairly with you. Though I expressed my warm
admiration of much that is to be found in your holy books, yet that
does not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>prevent me from being ready to welcome all that
is good and beautiful in other creeds: for example, some of the
original Vedic ideas that are still extant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Aquaviva, with irrepressible
agitation,&mdash;&ldquo;the terrible idolaters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I acknowledge,&rdquo; replied Akbar, calmly, &ldquo;that
there are many amongst them to whom the name is appropriate; but that
is not the case with all. Am I not right, Faizi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;and no one
knows that better than my Emperor himself. He, as well as I, worthy
Father, can testify to you that in these religions there is more than
one passage, touching the points already mentioned, which are not
inferior to your Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; said Aquaviva, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why impossible?&rdquo; asked Faizi, smiling. &ldquo;Are
you intimately acquainted with all the religious systems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know of them,&rdquo; said the Padre, &ldquo;is what I
have seen here and there; but I neither wish nor need a closer
acquaintance with them; what purpose could it serve? And can there be
more than one truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That speaks for itself,&rdquo; said Akbar; &ldquo;but the
question is, what is truth, and where is it to be found? Is it only to
be found in one religious system, or scattered through many? You
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>naturally will answer that you alone are in
possession of truth; but then, I ask, what are your grounds for saying
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth,&rdquo; replied Aquaviva, &ldquo;has been declared
to us by Jesus Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you say,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;but my friend Abdul
Kadir says that the truth was revealed to him through Muhammad the
great Prophet; and if your Christ is really the Son of God, it would be
well you should prove it, before calling upon him as such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Faizi, &ldquo;our Vishnuvites here say that
truth was declared to them, not only by wise and holy men, but also
through different incarnations of the Deity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authority of the one true Church rests on the Bible, the
Word of God,&rdquo; said Aquaviva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That again,&rdquo; answered Akbar, &ldquo;resembles the
authority of the Koran, the Khalifas and Ulamahs, and the authority of
the canonical books, and the teachings of the Vishnuvites, of whom
Faizi spoke just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely the faith that stands firmly is of
importance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are also all of like strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt but that Christianity is far older than the
teaching of Islam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not quite so ancient as the Vedas, on whose
authority is founded the religious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144"
href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>teaching of which we have
just spoken. Buddhism is also far more ancient than Christianity; and
while that, and I believe other religions, agree with yours in the
teaching of true humanity, and also, to a wonderful degree, with the
ceremonials of your church service, they go far beyond it in
tolerance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this manner we shall make no progress,&rdquo; remarked the
Padre, angrily, in spite of his respect for the Emperor, in whose
presence he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I agree with you there, worthy Father,&rdquo; said Akbar,
with a slight smile; &ldquo;but perhaps all would be better if you
would study our different faiths, and give yourself the same trouble
that we have not spared ourselves in making acquaintance with the
religion of our country. We could then at least compare the different
teachings, and so in the end decide on their comparative
worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not for that purpose I came here,&rdquo; answered the
apostle of the heathen; &ldquo;I was sent to preach the gospel, and
save souls from destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in that,&rdquo; said Akbar, in his usual calm tone,
&ldquo;I wish you all success; but I doubt whether you will achieve
much if you simply seek to force on others what you yourself hold for
truth, without inquiring what they on their side may consider
true.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Aquaviva, not alarmed at the
difficulties in his way, &ldquo;in the irresistible power of conviction
possessed by our faith alone, which in the end can soften the most
obdurate hearts, be they those of atheists or idolators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean by the teachings of your belief, do you
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, however much this teaching differs from that of the
other religions we have mentioned, I am but little inclined to share
the implicit faith you place in it. I respect all; and on those points
where you find other creeds to agree with your own there can be no
strife, and your work of conversion will be unnecessary. What do you
think, friend Faizi, is it not so? You are a man of calm judgment, not
an idealist as I or even our worthy Aquaviva, therefore your opinion is
for us of great weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the worthy Aquaviva agreed in this is very doubtful;
however, he could not refuse to listen to Faizi, who thus
began:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think, Sire, that your Majesty requires any
confirmation of your words from me. Still, I must assure the Padre,
although in doing so I take from him his dearest illusions, that even
though he may here and there make a convert, yet his teaching will
never take root, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span>neither among the Muhammadans nor among
those it pleases him to call heathen. Those who cling alone to the
dogma of the unity of God can never agree with what he inculcates about
the Trinity, three persons in one God. There are others to whom this
dogma will be less unacceptable, as they already worship the Great
Being under more forms than one; but they will find other points which
they also will never receive. For example, worthy Father, they will
never allow it to be possible that God created man to let him fall, and
that He offers Himself or His Son as a sacrifice, to save man; or that
He created man as if He did not know that man would fall; and that by
such extraordinary means of redemption alone could Divine justice and
Divine love be again brought into harmony. They would, excuse me for
saying so, consider such representations as utterly senseless, and feel
no inclination for their sake to say farewell to the faith handed down
to them by their fathers, which they find simpler and more rational. On
the other hand, if you were content only to inculcate your doctrine of
sin and reconciliation, and much of the same kind of teaching that I
will not now allude to, and to declare nothing but your Christian
morality, your ideas of humanity, of self-denial, and of love of man,
to which all should gladly be sacrificed&mdash;when you have taught all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>this, it is nothing new here; and to say the
least, your preaching is superfluous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Aquaviva, &ldquo;we hold fast by the truth
we declare&mdash;the one truth that can save lost man and doomed souls
from the eternal punishment of hell; and for this we are ready, here
and everywhere, to take up our cross and suffer reproach for the sake
of Jesus Christ, even should it be to the same martyr&rsquo;s death
that He and so many of His saints after Him have suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of that,&rdquo; said Akbar, laying his hand on the arm of
the angry and enthusiastic fanatic, &ldquo;there can be no question as
long as I reign over Hindustan; nor, do I think, have you met with
scorn anywhere under my government. On the contrary, honour has been
shown you, an honour so high that many are jealous of it; and you enjoy
the fullest liberty to declare your faith when and where you will. But
we spoke, if I do not deceive myself, of the chances of your doctrines
prevailing over those already professed in this country, and these, I
must confess with Faizi, appear to me but slight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Aquaviva ventured to remark, &ldquo;if your
Majesty would set the example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must first be convinced,&rdquo; said Akbar; &ldquo;or
do you wish that I should declare with my mouth what my heart
denies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I do,&rdquo; the other answered, &ldquo;wild
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>and absurd as the wish may appear; however, I do
not urge it. But I had so hoped, so believed that the reading of the
holy writings would have rendered the noble soul of Hindustan&rsquo;s
wise ruler steadfast in the one true faith that alone can save his soul
and ours from eternal perdition. And now I see my most cherished hopes
lie shattered. Is it not, then, to be excused if I have expressed
myself too strongly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need of excuse, my worthy friend,&rdquo; said
Akbar; &ldquo;I can quite understand your feelings. But I never said
that I would not listen to you; on the contrary, I will willingly give
you the opportunity of convincing me, if you can. For the present our
conversation must cease; but let us regard this evening as the
forerunner of others to come. This time we have touched on too many
topics; on our next meeting we will keep to one distinct point, and who
knows to what your learning and eloquence may bring me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If irony was mixed with the Emperor&rsquo;s grave words, neither his
voice nor bearing betrayed it. All that the Jesuit remarked was that
the audience was over, and thanking the Emperor for the honour he had
done him in listening to his words, he respectfully took his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All are the same,&rdquo; said Akbar to Faizi, when they were
alone; &ldquo;if we listen to <span class="corr" id="xd20e2695" title=
"Source: Abdal">Abdul</span> Kadir <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149"
href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>or Aquaviva, it is always
authority, faith, revelation, never one word of reason or judgment, or
of reasons founded on knowledge or experience. Still I always converse
gladly with these zealots. From books we can learn the various theories
of man&rsquo;s connection with the infinite; but the living words of
the professors of the various persuasions teach us far more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Faizi; &ldquo;but as to this
constant reference to authority and revelation, is it not natural and
unavoidable in those who, not content with the lessons of experience
and reason, seek the solution of the enigma of life in their own
imaginations? If they are shown the groundlessness or senselessness of
their propositions, what remains to them but to take refuge in the
authority of a revelation declared and handed down to them by their
forefathers? But it is singular that contradiction so seldom leads to
the study and criticism of their own doctrines; were it to do so, they
would soon become aware of the vanity of their theories. Proudly and
defiantly the towers and pinnacles of their temple rise into the
clouds, but examination would show them that the foundations are laid
in the shifting sands of phantasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments after Faizi ceased to speak Akbar was silent; on
resuming the conversation, he said&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right, Faizi; still I have a sympathy with
the people you reproach. And it may be that in some moment of
enthusiasm and poetical imagination we may be carried away to the
discovery of truth that we shall afterwards find to be supported by
reason and knowledge. But for the present no more of this; we have
other things to attend to, and presently I expect Ab&uacute;-l Fazl,
who has some important communication to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a subsequent evening another interview took place at Agra, which
had nothing in common with that just described, except that it also was
hidden from indiscreet eyes and ears.</p>
<p>After his first interview with Rezia, Siddha had more than once
sought for the servant who had guided him to her dwelling. At last he
met her in the neighbourhood of the imperial gardens, and received anew
from her an invitation to visit her mistress, which he hastened to
accept. Since then the visits had been repeated, following one upon
another, until at last the day that passed without Siddha sitting
beside Rezia in the verandah appeared to him empty and void. All that
Agra had to offer him of beauty and pleasure; however great the delight
he took in the favour of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, and, later, in that of the
Emperor himself; or the pleasure of conversation with Faizi, whose
house was always open to him, and who treated him as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>a
trusted friend; or the amusement he found in the society of Parviz and
that of his joyous comrades; all sank to nothing in comparison with the
quiet dwelling of the lonely Armenian. That the image of Iravati
retired more and more into the background was not strange, nor that
Rezia speedily became to him more than a pleasant, entertaining
acquaintance; nor was she herself entirely insensible to the
unconcealed homage of the young chief. A feeling of terror had overcome
him when he first made the discovery that, instead of loving her as a
dear friend, his feelings for her had in them a depth and passion that
until that moment he had never known; but he had soon become accustomed
to this thought, and from that moment only one desire was master of his
soul, that of calling her his, and knowing that his love was
returned.</p>
<p>On a certain evening Siddha was again seated on a divan beside his
fascinating hostess; before them was a low table decked with fresh
fruits and sparkling wine in golden drinking-cups. She seemed lovelier
than ever to him, deeper than ever the expression of her soft blue
eyes, that now full of tenderness, and now with an indescribable fire,
gazed up at him, and then again were hidden under the shadow of long,
silken eyelashes. The scent of roses and jasmine filled the air, and
moonlight, almost as bright as day, fell on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>verandah, and silvered the groups of trees and
fountains in the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siddha,&rdquo; said Rezia, with sudden gravity, interrupting
their gay, laughing conversation, &ldquo;you once did me a great
service in undertaking that my letter should safely reach Kashmir; can
I now ask of you a second, which, I tell you beforehand, may be of more
consequence to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Command, and I obey,&rdquo; said Siddha, without hesitation;
&ldquo;whatever you may desire, do not doubt but that I will endeavour
to fulfil it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prudence, my friend,&rdquo; said Rezia, playfully lifting up
her finger; &ldquo;you are committing yourself before you know what I
require; and you do this because, from your high rank and assured
position at court, you think you can look down on what a simple woman
like me can wish, and assume that the question is only how some one of
my whims may be gratified; but in this you may be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear to you,&rdquo; was the impetuous answer, &ldquo;no
such thought crossed my mind. Now, then, demand what you will, and I
obey your commands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rezia, approaching her worshipper a little
nearer, &ldquo;you are perhaps more concerned in what I wish than I am
myself. You imagine, perhaps, that I, leading this solitary life, know
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>nothing of what goes on in the palaces of Agra
and the Emperor&rsquo;s council. Accidental relations with people of
high station give me the opportunity of knowing more than you perhaps
suspect&mdash;more than you know of your own concerns, and of what
should be known to your country and your people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Siddha, &ldquo;that I know what you
mean; you allude to plans that may be formed to destroy the
independence of Kashmir, as the many party divisions there give hopes
that such plans may succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;but what you do
not seem to know is, that these plans are already ripe, that the
imperial army is ready for the invasion, and that you yourself are
destined to serve against your country and people; for your influence
among the faithful Rajp&uacute;ts, and your well-known name, will be
important, should you remain blindly obedient to the commands of
Akbar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear Rezia,&rdquo; said Siddha, making a faint attempt
to conceal under a cheerful voice the uneasiness that was mastering
him, &ldquo;even if this should be so, what is it to you? and what
moves you to speak to me of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own interests; but also the interest I take in you, my
friend. I told you, as you will remember, of a friend who was exposed
here to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>certain persecution. But now I will confess; I
deceived you&mdash;it was not a friend, it was myself. The husband to
whom my father&rsquo;s cruel command gave me, and whose tyranny I
detest, will soon return, and my own desire is to fly from him, to be
free, and some day perhaps in safety to be able to give myself to the
one I choose; and to attain this I sought Kashmir as my place of
refuge, and opened a communication with some of my friends there. But
should this country also become subject to Akbar, my hope vanishes and
I know not where to turn. Quickly you will again see me in the power of
this man, who has my fate in his hands; our happy meetings will be at
an end; and Rezia will cease to exist for you, as you,&rdquo; she
added, with a slight sigh, &ldquo;will for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Siddha, passionately; &ldquo;that shall
never happen. But what would you have? what means do you know of? what
do you ask of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; replied Rezia, calmly, &ldquo;that you
should not allow yourself to be used as a tool against your own
country, against yourself, against me. Remain by your own brave
followers; but when the decisive day comes, do not lead them against
us; but know how to go over to those of us, who, in spite of outward
show of subjection to the Emperor, have a secret understanding.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>Then a powerful party in Kashmir will side with
you, support you by their influence, and raise you to the greatest
honour; and in the end, though that is of less importance, you will
find a resting-place in my arms, who will ever be grateful to you for
your protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Siddha, following, among all other plans and
proposals, the thread of his own thought, &ldquo;that would be
treachery of the worst kind against the Emperor who has trusted
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, treachery,&rdquo; answered Rezia, with a
contemptuous laugh. &ldquo;As the Emperor has shown you some favour, he
naturally has a full right to use you as a tool against your country
and people, but you have not the right to repay him in the same coin.
Now be subject&mdash;or slave! However, act as you please. Your
assurances that you would do all I asked were nothing but the vain
promises men are wont to make to simple women. But enough! Let our
interview come to an end; not that I wish it, but it is better with
firm resolution to part from one another, than to continue our
intercourse only to see it inevitably broken off a few days later
against our will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Siddha, as Rezia turned from him, as
though to hide her grief. &ldquo;Nothing shall part us, and if for a
moment I hesitated, I did not deceive you when I promised to do
whatever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>you might ask. I repeat it, command and I
obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word as a Rajp&uacute;t. But why do you ask it? you know
well that I can do nothing but what you wish. Why should I keep silence
respecting that which you must long have known? At last let me say
freely, that you are dear to me, above everything, dearer than life or
even honour. I love you with a passion and devotion that until now I
should never have thought possible; I believed I knew what love was,
but what I took for it was only a childish liking. You have taught me
differently; teach me more; teach me what it is when love like mine is
returned. No slave can be more submissive to the will of his master
than I to you; no slave of Akbar&rsquo;s or of any one but yourself.
Whatever I may gain in the future, rank, esteem, riches, belong to you
alone. And the power you have over me you may use or misuse as you
will. But be mine, Rezia, mine as long as life lasts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Siddha,&rdquo; said she, softly withdrawing her hand from
him, &ldquo;it is not fitting that I should hear such language, nor
that you should use it. Remember that I am not yet free, and you
yourself have other ties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other ties!&rdquo; cried Siddha, passionately; &ldquo;I break
them, or rather I broke them long ago; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>could I not do so, I should curse the day when
they were laid on me. And you, if you are not free, I will soon make
you so. We will fly to Kashmir, to that far-away, beautiful country in
the north, where, as you say, Siddha Rama&rsquo;s name and influence is
well known, and where none will dare to injure you whom I protect, your
hated husband least of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will that protection avail against Akbar and his
favourites?&rdquo; asked Rezia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against him and his, as against all others,&rdquo; was the
proud reply; &ldquo;and against him we shall know well how to defend
the liberty of Kashmir, if it were only for a place of refuge for you
and for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot be yours,&rdquo; interrupted Rezia; &ldquo;and
it grieves me, in truth, that you have so spoken this evening. You
might have spared us all this, and then our friendly intercourse might
have continued, and led perhaps later to another and a closer tie. Now
all must cease, however deeply it grieves me. Go now, say farewell, and
forget me, it is better for you and&mdash;for me, whom you say you
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said Siddha, as he rose, and, with his head
sank on his breast, drew back a few steps, &ldquo;to part at once is
perhaps the wisest course. I see but too plainly that my love is
despised. It is true that for me, without you, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>there is no life, no happiness possible. Still
the continued martyrdom of meeting you, day by day, loving you more
dearly, and yet knowing that you belong to that hated, cursed stranger,
is more than I can bear. Fresh disturbances have broken out in the
south, in the Dakhin, and the Emperor has ordered part of the army on
service there. I will implore him to let me join them; and there in
battle with the wild mountain races I may soon find, not forgetfulness,
that is impossible, but an early and longed-for death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Siddha,&rdquo; said sadly the sweet, loved voice,
&ldquo;why such violence because a weak woman (who finds the strife
against herself and her own heart too much for her) seeks for a
moment&rsquo;s strength to withstand you? It is, as you said, better
that we should part, and yet&mdash;I cannot let you go; remain, it is
but a short pause; seat yourself again by my side, and let me enjoy,
even though it may be for the last time, that quiet conversation,
undisturbed by passion, that until now we have found so much pleasure
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before Siddha was quite aware of what he did, he was again
seated by the side of her who had so mastered his whole mind and
understanding. At her desire he seized the lute that lay beside them,
and tried to bring back to his recollection one of the songs of his

she had begged; but vainly he tried, sometimes beginning and then
breaking off, his memory failed him, and dejectedly he laid down the
useless lute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know no more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can neither think
nor remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, my singer,&rdquo; said Rezia, laughing; &ldquo;must
I set you the example? But let us first drink to one another.&rdquo;
And lifting a golden goblet to her lips, she made Siddha empty his, and
then began, in soft, melting tones, a Persian love song that soon
brought Siddha back to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; cried he, as Rezia finished, and he began
the description of a lover&rsquo;s reception from Kalidasa&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Seasons,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2788src" href=
"#xd20e2788" name="xd20e2788src">2</a> &ldquo;The Bride represented by
the Return of Summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The singer ceased, and she who listened to him had drawn nearer,
gazing at him with her fascinating eyes, that now shone with an
unwonted glow. Suddenly he seized both her hands, and drew her to him
with irresistible force. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Rezia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Rezia, be to me as
Kalidasa&rsquo;s bride&mdash;now and always mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She softly murmured Siddha&rsquo;s name and flung her arms around
his neck.</p>
<p>More than once since that evening a manly figure might have been
seen in the darkness of night carefully looking around him, and then
following the cactus road that led to the dwelling of the Armenian.
Iravati&rsquo;s lotus flower had struck against the frail vessel on
which he had embarked, and had been wrecked by a sultry wind.

received a Portuguese embassy in 1578 from Goa, at the head of which
was Antonio Cabral. He afterwards wrote to Goa, requesting that Jesuits
might be sent to him with Christian books. Rudolf Aquaviva, a man of
good family, who was afterwards murdered at Salsette, Antonio
Monserrat, and Enriques (as interpreter) were selected for this
mission, and despatched to Agra. They were most honourably received by
Akbar, and great hopes of his conversion were conceived. But there was
no practical result. Some years afterwards, in 1590, Akbar again
applied for instructors, and in 1591 three brethren came to Lahore. But
after a while, seeing no hope of good, they returned to Goa.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once more the lovely lady of Allahabad sat on the
balcony looking out towards the far-away mountains, from whence, now
long ago, had approached the eagerly awaited one. Nothing had changed
since that time: the same calm, silver waters and thick shade of trees,
and far beyond the mountain tops, while the same cloudless sunshine
lighted up the whole landscape. Ah! if only he were as
unchanged&mdash;he that now took part in all the dissipation of the
court and the many pleasures of the great city. Did he still think of
her, and daily regard her likeness as she did his? These doubts, that
had involuntarily arisen in her mind, appeared to Iravati an injury to
the man whom she esteemed as highly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>as she loved him, and
who at their last interview had so fervently pledged his word to her,
and had repeated the same promises in his letters. But these had now
for some time ceased. And why did he not return to her? Could he remain
so long parted without making any effort to see her again, even if it
were but for a day? Without doubt his duty prevented him, and he was
not yet able to obtain leave of absence. But oh! how long was the time,
and how the days and hours appeared to creep, as she waited and watched
alone!</p>
<p>As on that morning long ago, her musings were interrupted by the
appearance of her father the Governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iravati,&rdquo; he said, in his usual measured tones,
&ldquo;a guest has arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had come, then; he already awaited her; and her whole heart was
filled with impatient joy, but of which she showed no trace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A guest,&rdquo; continued Salhana, &ldquo;that for you to
receive will be as great an honour as a pleasure. It is Salim the
Prince, who, in obedience to his father&rsquo;s wishes, comes to pass
some time at Allahabad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a great effort Iravati concealed her bitter disappointment; but
to speak was to her impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Salhana, &ldquo;is not the news
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>welcome to you? There are many who would give
all they possess to enjoy the honour that awaits you. Naturally I do
not wish that any of the Prince&rsquo;s followers should see you, but
the future emperor is different; and it may be of importance both to me
and to Siddha that you should gain his favour. Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Iravati and her father entered the gallery where Salim was, he
advanced to meet and greet her with his usual light-hearted courtesy.
But suddenly all his boldness deserted him, and he stood still and
silent. Such a noble bearing, mingled with so much modesty, beauty so
grave, with an expression so winning and lovely, he never remembered to
have seen in any other woman; and, contrary to his custom, he waited
until Salhana had presented his daughter before greeting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am indeed grateful to
you for the trouble you have given yourself in coming to welcome your
guest. I have heard of you more than once, and&mdash;&rdquo; but the
courteous phrase that trembled on his lips appeared too insipid and
meaningless, and he continued&mdash;at the moment not being able to
find any better speech&mdash;&ldquo;It is indeed a pleasure to make
your personal acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honour shown by your Highness to my father and to me, I
prize highly,&rdquo; answered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>Iravati; &ldquo;and I trust
you will not find our quiet town at Allahabad too dull in comparison
with the capital, with its many pleasures and diversions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; returned Salim, &ldquo;the noble daughter of the
Governor will sometimes give me the pleasure of her company, I need not
fear that my sojourn in Allahabad will be tedious. But you speak of the
capital; you know it, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been in Agra,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never?&rdquo; said Salim; &ldquo;it is indeed time, my worthy
Salhana, that your talented daughter should see more of the world than
is possible in this remote fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time will come,&rdquo; answered the Governor, &ldquo;when
my daughter is under the protection of her intended husband, my future
son-in-law, whom your Highness has received with so much
kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether this recollection did not please the Prince it was difficult
to discover, but he at once became silent and knitted his dark
eyebrows; and when he spoke again it was on quite another subject. The
conversation continued for some time longer, and then Salhana gave his
daughter leave to return to her own apartment, and with a deep
reverence, Iravati took her leave, rejoicing that the interview was
over. The only impression left on her mind by the Emperor&rsquo;s son
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>the magnificence of his attire, although Salim
himself only regarded it as a simple travelling costume.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Salim, the Governor, and a third person were
seated in one of the inner apartments of the fortress, well secured
from all intruders or listeners, engaged, apparently, in consulting
over more important questions than how time should best be spent at
Allahabad. The third person was Gorakh, the priest of Durga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good for which we strive, my friends,&rdquo; began the
Prince, &ldquo;seems nearer; and it appears to me that it would be wise
to consider the present state of affairs, and then to think what
further preparations had better be made. You, Salhana, are, I believe,
the best informed of us three; as for me, at the court much is
suspected, and I come here in obedience to the wish, or rather the
command, of my father. Ab&uacute;-l Fazl&mdash;may Alla curse
him!&mdash;is, I know, at the bottom of this; but I hope one day to
have the opportunity of repaying him. And now for you,
Salhana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that all now goes
according to our wishes. In Agra, Delhi, Lahore, and other places, are
the true Muhammadan Umaras and other nobles embittered to the utmost
against the Emperor, through the contempt he shows for their religion
and by reason of the loss of many privileges of which he has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>deprived them. Nothing will be more welcome than
a revolution, and many will join it; including more than one of the
principal mansabdars. Abdul Kadir has been of great use in all this,
but we must not count much on him; he wishes to act openly, and every
now and then misgivings come over him of what he calls
treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your nephew?&rdquo; asked Salim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is entirely one of us. How he has been won over matters not;
it is enough that so it is. I had at first destined him as a spy on
Akbar, but soon saw that he would be worthless as such; he is too
simple, and too strictly brought up according to Kulluka&rsquo;s ideas,
to be of any avail for such a r&ocirc;le; and then, too, Akbar entirely
won him over, in his usual manner, at their first meeting. But in
another way he will do us better service: he has obtained the rank of
mansabdar, and will soon have the chance of further advancement; so
when the time fixed on comes, he will be in command of an important
body of Rajp&uacute;ts; and in Kashmir his name has great influence.
Then, when our plan is carried out, his co-operation will be of no
slight importance. At the chosen moment he will turn his troops against
the Imperialists, and doubtless his example will be followed by the
greater part of the Rajp&uacute;ts and Patans.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But now the plan itself, as it concerns Kashmir?&rdquo; asked
Salim again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears to me that nothing could be better,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;The interior strifes, for the most part fomented by us,
have come to a crisis; both parties have had recourse to arms, robbers
desolate the land; and, what is of greater importance, the adjacent
countries which form part of Akbar&rsquo;s kingdom are also convulsed.
This gives him a pretext of marching his army to the north, and
attempting to re-establish a lasting peace by the conquest of Kashmir.
His army is ready, and, if I do not deceive myself, his intention is to
place himself at the head of it, after the annual celebration of his
birthday has taken place. When the war begins, then suddenly our Siddha
and other followers will fall from him, and join the army of Kashmir;
and Akbar will have enough to do in making good his retreat. In the
meantime our party in Agra will have proclaimed Salim emperor, and
taken possession of the fortress and treasure. So if Akbar succeeds in
his retreat, he will find more fighting awaiting him, and the end must,
I suppose, be his abdication in favour of the Prince Royal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All,&rdquo; said Salim, &ldquo;is well calculated, and quite
in accordance with our original plan, which I see, with pleasure, is
now almost ripe. One question, however; is there no danger of any
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>part of our plan becoming known? is all arranged
with caution? That letter, for example, that was sent to
Kashmir,&mdash;supposing it should have got into wrong
hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That letter,&rdquo; answered Salhana, &ldquo;has safely
reached its destination; and who do you think carried it? No one less
than Kulluka himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What unpardonable rashness!&rdquo; cried Salim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least so,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;The
good man had no idea of what he was undertaking, and the letter was
given to him by Siddha himself, who equally had no idea of its
contents. He was trapped into charging himself with its safe delivery;
and had he, at the worst, glanced at it he could have given no
information, and no suspicion could have fallen on us, who were
naturally not named.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; said Salim, approvingly, and laughing
heartily. &ldquo;We thank you, Salhana, for your information. But has
not our worthy Gorakh his share for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes,&rdquo; answered the Yogi, who had hitherto
listened in silence; &ldquo;I have not been idle; as I told you, but
you thought it improbable, I have made my way not to the palace alone,
but to the private apartment of the Emperor. You know how anxious he is
to study the various religious systems and philosophies that are found
within his realm; and so he desired to become acquainted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>with
the ancient Yogi teaching, of which, although he had heard much, he
knew little or nothing, and on which neither the learning of Faizi nor
of Kulluka could throw much light. Then I found means, through some
confidential friends, of letting come to his ears my great knowledge of
the Yogi mysteries. Not long afterwards I was invited to court, and
Akbar received privately from me the first indications of the teaching
of <i>Concentration</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2883src" href=
"#xd20e2883" name="xd20e2883src">1</a> whereby mortal man comes more
and more into relations with the immortal Being, resolving all his
thoughts in the absolute, and participating in the infinite existence,
so that he attains to the power of being able at will to transport
himself to the greatest distance, while apparently he remains in the
same spot, and of assuming any form he pleases, or of making himself
invisible or lighter than air. To support this, and not to rest on
assurances alone, I brought one of my people before him, who is a great
adept in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>magic or trickery, and made him perform a feat,
at which, not without reason, the Emperor was much astonished. The man
seated himself on a low wooden stool, to which was attached a bamboo,
with a crooked handle like a walking-stick. Then a white cloth was
spread before him, so that he was entirely concealed; and when it was
again removed, he was found seated in the air, about two feet above the
stool, supporting himself by resting his out-stretched hand on the
crook of the bamboo. A most wonderful feat, and one that you must some
day see when we have time.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2896src" href=
"#xd20e2896" name="xd20e2896src">2</a> But enough: Akbar was not only
astonished, but still more desirous of being admitted to our mysteries.
As you understand, I took good care to tell him no more than was
necessary, still more to excite his curiosity; and now I have always
the opportunity of being admitted to his presence, a privilege of which
I make but a sparing use, but, as you may be assured, a good one.
Through my people I hear all that is of importance for our affairs.
Akbar&rsquo;s palace and private apartments are filled with people who
seek out all that happens, although in them he suspects <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>nothing more than the followers of a religious
fanatic or ascetic. By these means I can give you, Salim, and our
friend Salhana information on many matters, that would not otherwise
have been easily obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said Salim, &ldquo;we must confess that you
are almost a magician. But what do you demand as recompense for the
services that you render us? Salhana, we know, wishes, when our power
is established, to be named Viceroy of Kashmir; and if all goes well
his wish shall be fulfilled. Nothing for nothing I say with him; but
you, what are your wishes? It is best that all conditions should be
settled beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty Prince, allow me to call you so by
anticipation,&rdquo; answered Gorakh; &ldquo;if I ask you nothing,
simply nothing, that astonishes you, does it not? But I will try to
make it simple. In my turn I ask, what do you want for yourself? You
have already, one would think, everything the heart of man can desire;
you have treasures, palaces, lovely women to serve you, joyous friends
and companions, the most splendid wines, and only stand next to the
Emperor in this powerful and flourishing kingdom, and are certain of
succeeding him. And yet you have recourse to our help and that of
others, your inferiors, to carry out your dark, difficult, and even
dangerous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>plans. Why? Because you wish to govern at once,
and cannot wait until the death of your father leaves the throne vacant
for you. See, then, what you ask for yourself is what I ask for
myself&mdash;to govern. And while you, to-day, may be said to be ruler
over nothing, I reign already, though I ever strive for a more
extensive power. Hundreds who, if need were, would become an army
against the great of the earth, obey unconditionally my slightest sign
without question or hesitation. I, the poor, unknown priest, despised
by many, possess a power that you, in all your greatness, cannot rival.
And by what might are they thus subject to me? Through that which
nothing can resist, by which reason is silenced and the will destroyed,
so that man is nothing more than a living, moving corpse&mdash;the
power of religious fanaticism. Just a sign of my finger towards whom I
will, towards you or some other, is enough to show more than one of my
followers what new offering will be the most welcome to the
never-satiated Durga; and the higher the rank, the more welcome is the
victim. Even should the doomed one be warned beforehand, let him take
what precaution he will, let him surround himself with servants and
guards, yet nothing less than a miracle can save him. Close to him,
amidst his followers, are my trusted ones; and when the right moment
has struck, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173"
name="pb173">173</a>]</span>stillness of night, with no sound to awake
suspicion, suddenly the cord is round his neck, and with no time for
cry or groan, the long list of victims is swelled by another name. It
is true that occasionally, but seldom, the intruder is seized; but he
who tries to hold him grasps a body slippery as a snake, that glides
from his hands, and disappears as suddenly and silently as it came. But
suppose it came to the worst, and one of my Thugs was really taken,
what matters it? he dies with the certainty of participating in endless
bliss; and hundreds are ready to attempt to carry out what he failed
in, and sooner or later success will be theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yogi was silent for a moment, but neither of his listeners
spoke. Salhana, who was well acquainted with these strange confidences,
had listened with calm indifference, but saw no room for speaking;
while Salim, although not wanting in personal courage, turned pale at
the priest&rsquo;s words, and remained lost in thought, gazing before
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; continued Gorakh, &ldquo;I also govern in my
fashion. Those who withstand me, I sweep unsuspected from my path, and
those who know my power fear me; and be they of high or low rank, they
do my bidding. And do you not think that power so exercised has not
equal pleasures with yours? Can you imagine no feeling of pride at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>seeing yourself looked down upon and treated by
men with slight respect, and then to know that their actions, their
life and death, are to be disposed of according to your will? And I am
not the only one who so thinks. I know there are others, and in far and
distant lands, who, in silence and darkness, strive to govern those who
are looked on as the greatest rulers in the eyes of the world. More
than once in Agra, and in other places, I have spoken with men from the
far West, who have come hither to try and win converts to their
teaching, and, under the pretence of lending a willing ear to their
preaching, I have gradually become acquainted with their aims; and from
what I have learnt from them respecting the institution and working of
their order, I discover that they, or at least their chiefs, seek the
same God as I, though by another path. Their means, I say, are
different, though scarcely more humane: we strangle men, they burn them
alive. But though often they are resisted and persecuted, yet they know
how, in the name of the so-called faith, to rule over not worldly
sovereigns alone, but also over the spiritual head of their own Church,
while they flatter him by unconditional submission and obedience to his
will. And so you see, however strange it may at first appear, that the
existence and enjoyment of power does not lie in its outward
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>display, nor in its acknowledgment by
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Salim remained silent as Gorakh finished; but the look which
he cast towards him said more than words.</p>
<p>The priest laughed. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said he, slowly,
&ldquo;what thoughts at this moment occupy your Highness. An ally such
as I may become dangerous, and the question is whether it might not be
wise to get rid of him at once. But I am not simple enough to venture
into the tiger&rsquo;s den without the certainty of returning from it
in safety. My followers await me in yonder temple on the mountain; if
by the morning I do not rejoin them, they know well who the goddess
requires as an expiatory sacrifice for the death of her chosen
priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arranged with your usual prudence,&rdquo; said Salim.
&ldquo;But, worthy Gorakh, your prudence was superfluous; we have need
of your help in many cases, and should I, without reason, deprive
myself of it? But we have, I think, rather wandered from the subject of
our consultation. About one thing I am rather uneasy. What are we to
expect, Salhana, from your brother the Minister of Kashmir? Will he
choose our side? And if not, has he the power of injuring
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear greatly that he has,&rdquo; answered the Governor.
&ldquo;He will not forsake the cause of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>the present king; and
should he fall, would rather turn to Akbar than to us, from whom he
expects nothing but mischief to his country and people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, hand him over to me,&rdquo; said Gorakh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No questions. I say, hand him over to me, and he shall not
long stand in your way. There is another point of far greater
importance: I have reason to believe that a certain important person of
Kashmir, who has long been considered dead, but who, should he return
to his native land, would overturn all our plans, is still
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How! what!&rdquo; asked Salim, much disquieted. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean he whom you have already
guessed&mdash;Nandigupta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nandigupta! it is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why so? Was there ever any certainty about his death? All
we know is that he suddenly disappeared and has never more been heard
of, that is all. Some little time ago I discovered that among the
Him&aacute;layas, near Badari-natha, a hermit now lives, whose
description answers to that of the former king, and whom Kulluka, with
Siddha Rama, visited on their journey here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, indeed, seems dangerous,&rdquo; said Salim.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; continued Gorakh, &ldquo;I have set
some of mine on the track to discover the truth; and should my
suspicions turn out to be just&rdquo;&mdash;here he made a sign that
both his hearers understood&mdash;&ldquo;then he certainly will be
amongst those that Durga will welcome. It is now time for me to return
to my followers, and your Highness will excuse me if I take my
leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salim nodded his assent, wishing no doubt that it were possible that
the priest should never more set his foot outside the fortress; and so
for the present the three separated.</p>
<p>Evening after evening since that first day the sound of feasting and
revelry from the lighted walls of the fortress had fallen on
Iravati&rsquo;s ears, as she wandered alone through the park. There
feasted the future emperor of Hindustan with his boon companions and
dancers, seeking thus to repay himself for the weariness of the day,
and to forget for a while the cares that his own ambition had brought
on him. At times the faithful Nipunika, who mingled with the other
servants, and often looked in at these feasts, told her mistress
particulars of them, which made the blood rise to her innocent cheeks,
while she enjoined silence on her servant. Could it be possible that
Siddha took part in such festivals at Agra? And Salim, the future
governor of so mighty a kingdom, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178"
href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>and undisputed ruler over so
many peoples, how had he sunk! in spite of the high position to which
fortune had raised him.</p>
<p>And yet Iravati found no reason to despise the Prince when she met
him, as often was the case, in company with her father. His manner,
when he conversed with her, was that of a polished nobleman; and far
from allowing himself the slightest freedom, the respect and reverence
with which he treated her was such that the greatest princess could
have found no fault with it. There was no trace of flattery or empty
politeness in the words he addressed to her, but all was simple,
unconstrained and natural; while his conversation was amusing, and bore
witness to an unusual cultivation and extended knowledge. &ldquo;Oh,
if,&rdquo; she often thought to herself, &ldquo;he would but make a
better use of his many gifts, and would consider that to follow the
great example set him by his noble father is his holiest duty and
task!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One evening, as, lost in thought, Iravati seated herself on one of
the benches in the park, she became aware, to her astonishment, that
the silence that reigned around her was unbroken by any joyous sound of
revelry from the castle, and that no lights showed themselves from the
windows and galleries. Only a warm wind murmured through the leaves,
gently moving the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179"
name="pb179">179</a>]</span>branches of the trees, and every now and
then a sound of flutes or bells from distant villages told of some
peasant f&ecirc;te. Suddenly a sound of footsteps broke on the silence,
and through the evening twilight a man&rsquo;s figure became visible,
approaching the spot where the daughter of Salhana was seated. With a
feeling of terror, she rose to her feet, but, to her great
astonishment, recognised in the intruder the Prince himself, who,
drawing nearer, greeted her with his usual respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, noble lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if, unaware of
your presence here, I unwillingly have disturbed you; receive my
evening greeting, and I will not trouble you longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The disturbance,&rdquo; said Iravati, courteously,
&ldquo;cannot be otherwise than agreeable to me; still I must confess
that I was a little surprised. I believed your Highness was wont to
pass your evenings in another and more mirthful manner than by quiet,
solitary walks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so,&rdquo; answered Salim; &ldquo;and you have a right
to reproach me. I should have treated with more respect the roof that
sheltered you. But let bygones be bygones. In future no unfitting noise
of carousal shall disturb you in your palace, and break the silence of
the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iravati listened to him with astonishment. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>Why
should he make this declaration? and what was the cause of so sudden a
change?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A change has come over me,&rdquo; continued Salim, &ldquo;and
I believe no slight one, although the time has been short. Until to-day
I was&mdash;listen to me and do not draw back, I will confess all to
you&mdash;I cared only for pleasure; I was dissipated and even a
drunkard; I conceal nothing. But I have ceased to be all that; I have
broken with my former life, and the Salim of to-day is a very different
man from him of yesterday. From this hour I will live for duty and
honour alone, and for the weal of the people that may some day be
confided to my care. I will say farewell to all ambitious and unlawful
projects, and above all to those debasing, worthless diversions, in
which, until to-day, I sought distraction but never true enjoyment. I
will do all this if one wish may be granted, a wish on which my
happiness and my future depend, and also to a great extent that of my
kingdom; and the granting of this wish depends on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you, my lord,&rdquo; said Iravati, who,
alarmed as she was, would have been no woman had she not guessed to
what the words of the Prince tended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will soon understand me,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;when I
tell you what has caused this sudden change in my whole being. But
should I not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>rather leave it to you to guess, if you have not
already learned from my words that it can be no one but yourself? And
so it is,&rdquo; he continued, with ever-increasing enthusiasm, though
never out-stepping the bounds of reverence. &ldquo;From the first
moment I saw you, I knew, or rather felt, that you had an influence, a
serious one, over my fate; I who never before had cast my eyes down
before any one, did so at once before you, and in your presence felt
myself small and nothing; and so whenever I saw you and spoke to you,
and came to know you better, I felt still more clearly that my future
lay in your hands. I began to feel a horror of myself, my manner of
life, and so-called friends who aided me in passing evenings, and often
nights, in so unworthy a manner; yet I would not at once resolve to
break with it all; and I confess that when our feasts were in progress
your image often faded away from my mind, as wine obscured my senses;
but then when morning broke, with what shame and anger I regarded
myself! To-day my resolve is taken, and, as you see, is carried out.
All is quiet, there is no sound of revelry, my dancers are dismissed,
and most of my guests have already taken their departure from
Allahabad, or will do so to-morrow. All that is your work, and may it
be carried out still further! For that one thing is indispensable, we
must no longer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>remain acquaintances, meeting occasionally; a
closer bond must unite us. Iravati, is it possible to say more clearly
what I feel for you? Well, then, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! no, no, my lord!&rdquo; cried Iravati, clasping her hands
supplicatingly; &ldquo;do not say the words that are hardly on your
lips, for I may not hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May not,&rdquo; repeated Salim, &ldquo;or will not? When a
request is made to you by me, it seems there should be no question
whether you may hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both then,&rdquo; replied Iravati, firmly, &ldquo;both may
not and will not; may not, because my word and faith bind me to
another; and will not and cannot grant your wish because my whole heart
and life are given to that other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was fortunate for her that the increasing darkness hid the fierce
expression that these frank, imprudent words called forth on the
Prince&rsquo;s face; had she seen it she would have shuddered at the
thought of what might befall that other from such a rival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider well,&rdquo; said Salim, after a moment&rsquo;s
silence; &ldquo;think what you recklessly fling from you for the sake
of a young man once dear to you, and who for the moment still appears
to be so, but who, even should he remain true to you, can never offer
what the future ruler of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>empire of the Mughals can give. I
do not speak of the treasures that should be yours, or of the luxury
that would surround you, seated by my side, and ruling over the
kingdoms and princes of Hindustan, for I know how little temptation
there is in all that for a soul noble and elevated such as yours. Still
it is not to be despised. You think you know what riches and luxury
are, but what you have hitherto seen is but tinsel in comparison with
the splendour of the palaces and gardens of Agra and Delhi. But let
that be. Think what a glittering future you throw from you in choosing
to become the wife of a simple unknown nobleman, instead of ruling over
the deeds of the mightiest monarchs, while all the great and noble bow
before you, and the prosperity of millions depends on you. Even as I
place my lot in your hands, so I swear from to-day to place also that
of my future subjects. Your decisions shall be my laws, for I know well
that you will command nothing but what is noble, good and wise, and no
one in the whole kingdom oppressed justly or unjustly but will find
protection in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vainly the future ruler awaited an answer. Iravati was silent, but
it was a silence that gave no hope of consent. She had turned from him
as if to hide her sorrow, and buried her face in her hands. Even this
glorious future made no impression on her. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Iravati,&rdquo; said Salim, in a deeply moved voice,
&ldquo;do not at once deprive me of the peace with which your
appearance filled my whole soul. Through you I had become quite a
different man from what I was; do not let me fall back again. Have pity
on me, and on the thousands that with you by my side would find a
benefactor in me, but without you, in all probability, a tyrant. I am
weak, I know, but I would be strong as a hero, if from your words and
presence I might draw my strength. Why should it be refused me? It will
only cost you one word, and the crown of India lies at your feet; and
you have nothing to do but to stretch out your hand and place it on
your head. But I see,&rdquo; he continued, passionately, &ldquo;that my
respect, my admiration, and my love are nothing to you; you despise the
prince for a miserable adventurer, to whom you are bound by chains
forged without thought; but think well what you do, what you venture,
and what fate may await you and him also, if ever the love of one
powerful as I is turned to rage and hate. But I am speaking wild and
foolish words,&rdquo; he added sadly, letting his head sink on his
breast. &ldquo;What right have I to your love? However high my station,
I am not worthy of you. I am old before my time; that other is young,
beautiful, with a heart unspoiled by the world. Why should I then
complain? what I am <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"
name="pb185">185</a>]</span>is my own doing, and that of an unhappy
fate, which has placed me in a station for which I am unfitted. But ah!
how different, how different might all have been, if fate had thrown
you in my way earlier! Now it is too late, too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Prince,&rdquo; said Iravati, gently, &ldquo;you do
yourself wrong; you have reason for reproaching but not for despising
yourself. And be assured, I do not despise or scorn you, even if I can
never be yours; in truth, had I known you earlier, even as you are now,
but before another had won my love and faith, I might have returned
your affection. You cannot really wish me to break my pledged word; and
if I did you would lose the respect for me on which your love is
grounded. But even in that case, which now is impossible, your high
rank would have been no temptation. The luxury and splendour in which
you live could never have been my element; and the great responsibility
you were ready to lay on my shoulders, I could never have borne. But
why should we lose ourselves in thought of what might have been, but
can never be? The unknown powers that rule our fates have willed
otherwise, let us submit to their decision, which must be just and wise
for you as well as I. And so leave me, my gracious prince and lord, in
the lowly state which you found me; go and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>forget me, now and always; and if you do
remember me, let your thoughts be of that moment when nobler and more
elevated feelings made themselves master of your soul. As for me, my
thoughts will follow you in your future, which will, I hope and trust,
be rich in noble deeds, when you succeed to the throne of the great
Emperor; and be certain that amongst your numberless subjects none will
watch your path in life with deeper interest than she who now implores
you to leave her, and to release her from the hard duty of disobedience
to your wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeking for an answer both fitting and convincing, stood the despot
who perhaps never before in his life had met with contradiction.
Silently he stood before the young girl; now about to speak, and then
restraining himself, seeking vainly for words to give expression to the
conflicting feelings that thronged his brain. At last he approached
Iravati, seized her hand and lifted it to his lips, then turned and
disappeared in the darkness, without a single word.</p>
<p>The next morning, greatly to Salhana&rsquo;s alarm, he heard that
the Prince had left the Castle of Allahabad accompanied by a single
servant, but whither he had gone no one knew. <span class=

<i>Yoga</i> (concentration) is the name of the second division of the
S&aacute;nkhya system of Hindu philosophy. It was first taught by
Patanjali. He asserted that the soul <i>was</i> Iswara (God), and that
man&rsquo;s liberation is to be obtained by concentrating his attention
on Iswara. <i>Yoga</i> is, therefore, the union of man&rsquo;s mind
with the Supreme Soul. When a man is perfect in profound meditations or
&ldquo;steadyings of the mind,&rdquo; he gains a knowledge of the past
and future, he has the power of shrinking into the form of the minutest
atom, and gains mastery over Nature&rsquo;s laws.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Weighing of the Emperor.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What a bustle was there in the thronged bazar as
Siddha, in the morning, wandered through the busy rows of shops, on
which were spread out in rich abundance everything that could tempt the
eye and purse. And what a strange and wonderful mingling of various
peoples and races, the different representatives of which jostled
against and crossed each other&rsquo;s paths without betraying any
surprise, so well accustomed were they to the sight. Here the natives
of the land, Hindus of more or less pale complexions, their servants of
various bronzed shades; there, too, the proud ruling
races&mdash;Persians, Arabs, and Tatars, Armenians and Jews from the
west, and also sons of the Celestial Kingdom, with their long tails and
wide <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>flowered robes; and there men who especially
struck Siddha, as he had never before seen their like, men most
strangely clad, with pointed, broad-brimmed hats decorated with
feathers, short doublets, wide velvet trousers, and high boots, and
with long, straight swords hanging from coloured shoulder-belts. They
were in company of the spiritual Fathers, one of whom but a short time
since, had been admitted to the presence of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Among all this throng many had come to make their own purchases,
others only to wander and contemplatingly watch the bustling crowd.
Numbers of women, of many nations and classes, were also to be seen,
some in the costume of the people, simple, but graceful and pleasing;
others in coloured and gaudy Persian attire, and some closely veiled,
according to the strict Muhammadan law, and showing nothing human
excepting a pair of red-slippered feet, and a pair of dark eyes that
glittered through round holes in the upper veil that enveloped
everything. Some were busied with household purchases, others with the
acquisition of useful knick-knacks.</p>
<p>Just as Siddha was about to inquire from some of the passers-by who
the strange men were, he saw his friend and benefactor Faizi approach,
and addressed his question to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are Franks,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;called
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>Portuguese; they come from far-away countries in
the West, for the sake of commerce; and those with them have come to
try and convert us to what they say is the only religion which can save
souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those two,&rdquo; asked Siddha, &ldquo;coming from the
other side? do they belong to them? They wear nearly the same clothing,
but their companions appear to me fairer, and how red their beards
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are also Franks,&rdquo; answered Faizi, &ldquo;though
not quite the same as the others. They are English,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e3032src" href="#xd20e3032" name="xd20e3032src">1</a> who seek
to drive out the Portuguese, but with little success; however, they are
well received by our Emperor and our great people.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>A few years later, Faizi would have been able to point out others
among these visitors from the West, who, though also included under the
name of Franks, yet were quite different. He could have pointed to the
robust and somewhat plump figures and good-humoured faces of Hollander
and Zeelander, who, under Pieter van der Broeche,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3038src" href="#xd20e3038" name="xd20e3038src">2</a> came to seek
their own fortunes and those of their masters the Directors of the East
India Company. For long years they were considered both by English and
Portuguese as their most formidable rivals in the markets of Hindustan,
and as men who knew how to sustain the fame of the flag of the
Netherlands in the Indian waters against the Gijs, or
&ldquo;Gijsooms&rdquo; as they mockingly, though not very
grammatically, named their arch enemies. But their time was not then
come.</p>
<p>As the two Englishmen passed by, Siddha looked at them with a
curiosity which, though perhaps natural, at first seeing such
strangers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>yet was far from courteous; but Siddha
felt&mdash;although he had heard nothing of these people&mdash;very
little respect for them, and even Faizi seemed to consider them hardly
worthy of a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cursed proud Moors!&rdquo; muttered one of these sons of
Albion in his own tongue as he passed. Had these men, the haughty
Indians and half-despised English, been able to cast one single look
into the future, and could the former have guessed that the descendants
of the latter would one day rule over their people and country, they
would certainly have observed them with more attention. With still
closer interest would they have gazed, if anyone had told them that
these strangers sprang from the same race, and stood nearer to Siddha
than many of his friends whose origin was from the Semitic race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The visits of all these strangers,&rdquo; said Faizi,
&ldquo;do us no harm; on the contrary they give fresh impulse to our
trade and various industries; and from them also we have many good
painters and other artists. Then we have learnt much from them
respecting their own countries. Still they must not attempt to play the
master here, which appears to be rather according to their
tastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then surely we should show them the door,&rdquo; said Siddha.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That would soon happen, I can assure you. But now for another
subject. Have you tried my bay that we spoke of the other
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have,&rdquo; answered Siddha, &ldquo;and with the
greatest pleasure; it is a magnificent animal.&rdquo; And he broke out
with praises of Faizi&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are pleased with him, then?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
will send him to your stables; you can keep him if you will; and in the
coming campaign he will be of use to you. Your grey is a beautiful
horse and well broke, but scarcely strong enough; and the bay is
uncommonly so. I ride him but seldom, for I must confess I have become
rather lazy and prefer a quieter animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Siddha, overcome at such goodness,
&ldquo;this is indeed a costly present, which I have not deserved. Your
bay is a splendid thoroughbred Arab, such as I have never before
ridden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I offer my friends anything it ought to be worth
having,&rdquo; said Faizi. &ldquo;Now I want to tell you of something
else: about a meeting that took place yesterday evening at the palace,
and at which I wish you had been present. In spite of state troubles
that again overwhelm the Emperor, he found both time and inclination to
hold one of his philosophical and theological gatherings, for which,
just now, there is an opportunity, as the Christian missionaries from
Goa are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>again here. Yesterday a number of Ulamas and
Mullahs were assembled in one of the great halls of the palace. Among
them naturally Abdul Kadir appeared; then there were the Jesuits, a
Jew, and a Parsee, and your former tutor Kulluka, who has returned
here, and whom doubtless you have already greeted; my brother
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl was also present, and I also had that honour, and
took for my part in the course of the discussion your ancient
atheistical philosophy of nature. Akbar himself inclined a little my
way, while Kulluka defended the orthodox Brahmanical Vedanta,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3068src" href="#xd20e3068" name="xd20e3068src">3</a>
and Ab&uacute;-l Fazl the ordinary human ground. Kulluka detected him
now and then in Buddhistic heresies, but let them pass, saying there
was no Buddhist present to defend his creed. You know there are some
here, but none fit to take part in these discussions. The Emperor
scarcely took any part in what went on, but only listened; and perhaps
the most remarkable part of these discourses was their conclusion.
Nothing could be better ordered or more courteous than the beginning;
our Mullahs, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>calm and grave, saying but little; nothing could
be more gentle than the Padres, piping as sweetly as bird-catchers; the
Jew, a follower of Maimonides,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3079src"
href="#xd20e3079" name="xd20e3079src">4</a> was the same, but very
silent, and not quite at his ease; the Parsee was poetical and not
always very intelligible; and as for us, we every now and then threw in
some problem or argument, gathered from the philosophers of old days,
or that we had learnt from the Arabs or Persians, and which did not
appear to be quite to the tastes of the disputants. By degrees they
began to grow warm, and from arguments proceeded to assertions, and
from assertions to hard words, especially between the Muhammadans and
Jesuits, though on the whole we were not spared; and in the end there
was shouting, cursing, and noise, in spite of the presence of the
Emperor, enough to deafen us. In all this the Mullahs were foremost,
who, as you understand, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>consider themselves as the most
injured. Akbar sat watching this foolish scene, not without secret
satisfaction, and glanced every now and then at me with a smile; but at
last it became too much for him, and he saw that in his presence it was
not fitting such a spectacle should continue. &lsquo;Faizi,&rsquo; said
he, signing to me, &lsquo;have the door opened to these people, as they
no longer know how to conduct themselves. I gave them the fullest
opportunity for defending their various religious theories against each
other, in order that I might decide who had the best grounds for his
opinions; and what have they done? Each has endeavoured to outdo his
neighbour in shouting and cursing; nothing else. Let there be an end of
it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;we had better send
them all away; if two only should remain, there will be no end to the
strife.&rsquo; Akbar laughed, but rising from the seat where he had
calmly remained all through the storm, he said, in his powerful voice,
which at once enforced silence on all around, &lsquo;We thank you,
gentlemen, for the pleasant evening we have passed, due to your
kindness and interesting discussions. We hope for another such
interview before long, but the present one is closed,&rsquo; and with a
sign of his hand he dismissed them. The greater part withdrew,
grumbling. Oh, Siddha, how foolish men are thus to curse and hate each
other for the sake <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"
name="pb196">196</a>]</span>of abstract problems, of which they know
nothing, and which, even if they did, would not advance them one single
step in the practice of what honour and duty enjoin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you; and to follow the two last are often
hard enough,&rdquo; answered Siddha, with a sigh, knowing far more of
the difficulties of which he spoke than the other suspected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now tell me,&rdquo; said Faizi, &ldquo;how it comes that
you are here; I thought that you, with your men, were already on your
way to join the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had started,&rdquo; said Siddha, &ldquo;but received
counter-orders on the road. We are to remain some days longer at Agra,
to my great pleasure, as it gives me the opportunity of being present
at the great festival of to-day, which celebrates the Emperor&rsquo;s
birthday, of which I have heard so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That there was another reason for rejoicing at a longer delay in
Agra, Siddha did not think it necessary to add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Faizi, &ldquo;it is time to go
to the palace before the durbar. The Emperor receives, as you know, the
foreign ambassadors to-day. Come with me, and you can take your place
among the officers of your rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Siddha had been more than once <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>present at a durbar, yet as with Faizi he
entered the great throne-hall, where the Emperor had already taken his
place, the impression made upon him was almost as great as on the first
occasion. He looked with admiration at the splendid white marble
columns and walls inlaid with beautiful mosaics, delicate arches, with
silk and velvet curtains falling in rich folds. He was much struck by
the great assembly, which was larger and more splendid than any he had
yet seen. At one end of the hall, lit by a softened light from above,
was the Great Mughal, seated on a throne sparkling with precious
stones; on both sides, standing in long ranks, were the Umara,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3102src" href="#xd20e3102" name="xd20e3102src">5</a>
the ministers, generals, and nobles of high rank, and then ambassadors
from neighbouring countries in their various costumes, among them the
two Jesuits; and at the end the lesser officials and officers, amongst
whom Siddha, according to his rank, had taken his place.</p>
<p>The chief part of the ceremony was the exchange of presents. The
ambassadors and others approached the Emperor in their turn. On
reaching the throne they raised their right hands to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>their foreheads and bowed their heads before the
Emperor, then placed their presents, consisting chiefly of costly
objects of art, by the side of the step on which the throne was raised,
and in their turn they received presents on behalf of the Emperor.
Aquaviva also drew near the Mughal, bearing a splendidly bound Latin
Bible, which, according to custom, he was about to lay down; but Akbar,
rising from his throne, advanced a step or two, and took the book from
the hands of the missionary. &ldquo;We thank you, worthy Father,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;for this kindly thought, and trust that what we have to
offer will not be less welcome to you,&rdquo; and taking from the hands
of a Brahman standing by his side a voluminous and beautifully
ornamented manuscript, he presented it to the Jesuit, saying,
&ldquo;This is a copy of the &lsquo;Atharva-Veda,&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3120src" href="#xd20e3120" name="xd20e3120src">6</a>
one of the most ancient of our holy books of India; it is accompanied
by a Persian translation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With deep respect Aquaviva received the imperial gift, though one
might question whether in truth he was much pleased, and if he did not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>see in it some allusion to the meeting of the
preceding evening; which was the more probable as the Emperor was
always informed beforehand what presents were to be made him, that the
return might be appropriate. But whatever the Padre thought, it was not
difficult to guess what impression this affair made on the orthodox
Brahmans. There was a frown on almost every forehead in their ranks,
and Abdul Kadir could scarcely restrain his indignation. They could not
read the meaning of the return present, and how by it Akbar wished to
show that he took no part with the Christians. All they saw was the
special honour shown to a Christian. Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, who understood
it better, nevertheless shook his head, vexed at the needless defiance
and insult to the Muhammadans offered by the (in other respects) humane
and wise Akbar; still he confessed that they almost deserved it for
their unmanly conduct of the previous evening.</p>
<p>After the ceremonial of the reception of presents was over, the
Mughal was for some time occupied with giving audiences and
appointments; among others our Siddha was called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siddha Rama,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with good reason we are
content with you, and, to prove it, we name you from to-day Mansabdar
over a thousand; show yourself always worthy of our trust and
favour.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>A deep colour mounted to Siddha&rsquo;s face, as silently, according
to the usage, he bent his head before the Emperor, in token of his
gratitude for this fresh favour. He worthy of Akbar&rsquo;s confidence!
Could there be one in the army that deserved it less? Yet the Emperor
had need of his interest and assistance in Kashmir, so that it was not
generosity and kindness alone which led to this promotion. Akbar only
saw in the confusion of the young warrior an easily explained and
praiseworthy modesty at finding himself so openly laden with favours,
and nodded to him kindly as he signed to him that he might
withdraw.</p>
<p>It was now almost time that the people&rsquo;s feast should begin,
and for it was destined a field not far from the town. Towards it was
now streaming from all the streets and along all the roads a
brilliantly coloured throng, some on foot, some riding either on horses
or richly caparisoned elephants; some, too, were on camels laden with
eatables and refreshments of all kinds for the many that cared to take
part in the rejoicings. Mingling in the merry crowd were Siddha and his
friend Parviz, whom he had met on leaving the palace, and who had
heartily congratulated him on his new command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said Siddha, &ldquo;how go your
affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean my own private ones, do you not?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>answered the other, laughing. &ldquo;On the
whole they go on well. Lately I have several times seen her to whom my
heart belongs; and, though of course it was in secret, yet I have
reasons for suspecting her father, Todar Mal,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3142src" href="#xd20e3142" name="xd20e3142src">7</a> knew all
about it, although he gave himself the airs of knowing nothing. I
believe my uncle Faizi has something to do with this favourable change
in affairs. &lsquo;May Allah bless him!&rsquo; as the pious Abdul Kadir
would say.&rdquo; And here the good Parviz wandered off into a stream
of praises of the beauty and virtues of her he loved, which, deeply
interesting to him, was not quite so much so for his hearer. However
this might be, the one subject occupied the two friends until they
reached the spot where the festival was to be held. Here the view was
as full of life as that of the court had been, but far fuller of mirth
and merriment. Endless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>numbers moved in lightly coloured
groups over the great undulating plain where countless tents, great and
small, were pitched. Above all, the elephants with their dark bodies,
bright-coloured cloths, and richly ornamented <i>haudas</i>, contrasted
picturesquely with the riders and those on foot. The imperial elephants
were decorated with golden breast and head plates, set with large
smaragds; and their gigantic bodies bore a treasure enough to make the
fortune of any simple burgher. On one of these the Mughal himself was
seated, and dismounting in a circle of his courtiers, and followed by
them, repaired to the spot where the great ceremony of the day was to
be celebrated. This ceremonial deserves attention, so strange and
impressive was it. Many have endeavoured in different ways to explain
what it betokened, but the true meaning has hitherto escaped all
historians.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3150src" href="#xd20e3150" name=
"xd20e3150src">8</a></p>
<p>On a little height was erected a large and strong pair of scales,
large enough easily to hold a man. One scale was heaped with gold,
silver, and precious stones, while the other stood empty, high in the
air. On this the Emperor now took his place, in sight of hundreds and
thousands of his subjects, who crowded round from all sides;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>and the other scale was added to or taken from
until it exactly balanced the illustrious person of the Great Mughal,
who well held his own against the precious metal. It was a pity that
other things could not be laid in the scale, such as duty, honour,
faith, and enthusiasm for all that is good and beautiful; then surely
Akbar would not have been found wanting in the balance. When the
weighing was over he stept calmly from the scales, and the gold and
silver were distributed amongst the crowd. Towards the end the Emperor
mixed among those around him, throwing among the bystanders small
golden objects in the form of flowers and fruits, addressing here and
there kind and friendly words&mdash;confirming many afresh in their
conviction that in Akbar the people had not only a great and powerful,
but also a benevolent ruler, to whose heart the well-being of his
subjects was dearer than his own greatness.</p>
<p>After the grave ceremonies of the day were over, the real
festivities began, and every kind of diversion occupied the numberless
visitors. Here the jugglers and conjurors displayed their foolish art,
and performed feats of strength; there dancers to the sound of
monotonous music, and with slow movements, performed their dances; and
further on, horsemen at full gallop lifted rings from the ground at the
end of their long lances. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>On one spot was a wonderful and
horrible exhibition of two of those beings peculiar to India, who think
they combine a religious act with self-torture. They were suspended
twenty feet above the ground by means of an iron hook driven into their
backs and hung by a rope to a cross-beam.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3162src" href="#xd20e3162" name="xd20e3162src">9</a> Here, where
such a sight was rare, it excited great attention, and Parviz stood
gazing at it with interest, very different from Siddha&rsquo;s
indifference, who was well accustomed to such spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can possess the people?&rdquo; said Parviz to his
friend. &ldquo;It is said they do this prompted by religious fervour;
but if so, why do they choose a day of public rejoicing and festivity
to exhibit themselves? It is not a pleasant sight, but I cannot
understand how it is they appear so at their ease, and so free from
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can explain it to you,&rdquo; said Siddha.
&ldquo;You know that such tortures as we are now looking at are
considered by our fanatics as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>meritorious actions, by which
heaven may be gained; and those that gaze upon these martyrs, and give
them money, participate in the merit; and the more superstitious the
people are, so much the greater are the gains. But the secret of their
art is not known with certainty, although I believe there are grounds
for suspecting how it is done. If I am not deceived, they are always
accompanied by women, although they are never seen with them, and these
for about half a day before an exhibition pinch them between the
shoulder-blades until the spot is without feeling, and the hook can be
inserted without causing them any pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful kind of pleasantry,&rdquo; remarked Parviz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a wretched one, too. Whatever support it receives
from superstition, by respectable Brahmans it is only looked upon with
contempt. But did you not say there were to be elephant and wild beast
fights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, and by yonder flag I see they are about to begin;
let us make our way there and find a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not difficult, for their rank gave them instant admission
to the space railed off, and provided with seats, where the combats
were to take place. In the midst the Emperor was seated surrounded by
his courtiers. They had not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href=
"#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>waited long when from the opposite
sides the fighting elephants entered the arena, each covered with a
splendid cloth, and mounted by a brightly dressed mahout. Very little
preparation was necessary. No sooner did the gigantic animals approach
each other, than, rising on their hind legs with a snort, they seized
each other with their trunks, each endeavouring to stab his foe with
his long tusks, while their riders, now clinging by their knees behind
the creatures&rsquo; ears, and now holding by their hands to the girth
of the cloth, still kept their places. For some time the fight
continued with uncertain fortune; now one elephant was driven
backwards, and now the other. At last one was overthrown. His mahout
leaping nimbly to the ground alighted on his feet, and the rider of the
victor struck his hook into the constantly kept open wound behind the
ears, and forced him to draw back without injuring his fallen foe. The
Emperor applauded loudly, his example being followed by the courtiers
and spectators, and then they slowly left the tribunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Akbar seems to have a great liking for these combats,&rdquo;
said Siddha to his friend, as they continued their walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;Akbar likes everything
that displays courage and dexterity, whether in man or beast. As you
know, he is of unusual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>strength himself, and unsurpassed
by any in the use of arms; and his personal courage in war and hunting
is of that description that one might call recklessness. He seems to
seek danger instead of avoiding it, and his generals and hunting
comrades have at times enough to do with him when his blood is up. You
must have heard of his adventures; certainly some are exaggerated, but
you can trust to Faizi, who has been present at many, and who will tell
you about them some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus talking they wandered on, and at last having seen all they
wished, turned towards the city. Suddenly Siddha stood still, struck
with astonishment: his eye had accidentally fallen on the <i>hauda</i>
of a magnificently caparisoned elephant, and the lady he there saw,
with one or two others leaning back on the silken cushions, could be no
other than Rezia! Her thin veil fastened with diamonds had been pushed
on one side, there could be no mistake, and there by her side was the
well-known servant. But what was she doing here, she who lived in
solitude, carefully hidden from all eyes&mdash;just at this moment,
too, when she believed that Siddha had marched with the army! Could she
have deceived him? could she be other than she had told him?</p>
<p>As calmly and indifferently as was possible, he asked his companion,
pointing to Rezia, who had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>not seen him among the foot
passengers&mdash;&ldquo;Do you know that lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She with the veil thrown back, and a servant holding a fan of
peacock feathers?&rdquo; asked Parviz. &ldquo;Certainly I know her, and
I wonder that you do not; however, of late she has shown herself but
seldom. She is&rdquo;&mdash;and here Parviz named a name which gave our
friend such a shock as never before in his whole life he had
experienced; and he felt as if, standing on the brink of a precipice
amongst his northern mountains, he had been seized with a sudden
dizziness and fallen into the abyss beneath. &ldquo;She is,&rdquo; said
Parviz, &ldquo;a lady of whom, at any rate, you must have
heard&mdash;Gulbadan,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3205src" href=

Newbery set out on his return journey through Persia. Fitch went to
Bengal, whence he visited Pegu and Malacca, and eventually took ship

Gujrat was highly approved by the Emperor; and he was similarly

<p class="first">&ldquo;How can the name of that woman affect
you?&rdquo; asked Parviz, astonished at Siddha&rsquo;s strange bearing.
&ldquo;You have not, I trust, fallen in love with Gulbadan at first
sight? I would scarcely advise you to do so; although Faizi is goodness
itself, he is not always quite gentle where his wife is concerned, with
whom he is desperately in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a passing remembrance,&rdquo; replied Siddha,
recovering himself as well as possible, &ldquo;awakened by that name,
but which has nothing to do with Faizi&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; rejoined the other; and they
silently proceeded on their way.</p>
<p>To be alone, to escape from Parviz as soon as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>possible,&mdash;no other thought occupied his
companion, and seeing one of his men walking up and down, &ldquo;Excuse
me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have to speak with that man, and,
thanking you for your pleasant company, I must for the moment say
farewell.&rdquo; And hastily greeting his friend, and beckoning to the
horseman to approach, he was soon in conversation with him on subjects
connected with the service, but as suddenly broke it off directly
Parviz was out of sight. He then hurried on, not minding where his
steps carried him, only on and on, thinking and dreaming, as though
bewildered with drink. &ldquo;Gulbadan, Faizi&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;
Treachery again, then, though this time involuntary, yet of the worst
description, against the man by whom when a stranger he had been
received with the utmost kindness, and in whom he had always found the
truest of friends, and to whom he owed privileges and favours that no
one in his place could have obtained without such protection.
Treachery, too, against the Emperor, who had laden him with unexpected
and undeserved favours; treachery and shameless faithlessness against
her to whom once he had given his heart and pledged his word; and all
for the sake of one who had deceived him,&mdash;and whom he must
despise,&mdash;and yet love above everything and for ever. What should
he do? Honour and duty spoke loudly,&mdash;flight, instant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>flight, alone could save him. He knew and felt
that delay would only again place him on the brink of a bottomless
abyss. But to leave her so suddenly, without any preparation, any
explanation&mdash;she, who, though weak, still loved him; and if she
had led him astray, she, too, had sacrificed honour and
duty;&mdash;would that be acting rightly? would it be fair? was it
possible that he could do it?</p>
<p>For a long time Siddha wandered on, not knowing where he went. At
last he looked round, and found he was not far from the city, and near
the habitation of Rezia&mdash;the Rezia of happy days now gone
by&mdash;and which, as now he remembered, was situated close to
Faizi&rsquo;s villa. Evening began to close in; it was the hour that he
was wont to approach the garden wall, and, at a well known signal, to
be admitted by the servant. A few moments later he again stood by the
wall, gave the signal, and, as the door was opened, hurried in.</p>
<p>Rezia, or rather Gulbadan, was reposing comfortably on a divan by
the verandah, little thinking of Siddha, who she imagined was on his
way to join the army, when suddenly the man she thought miles away
rushed into her apartments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, Siddha!&rdquo; she cried, starting in alarm to her feet.
&ldquo;I thought you were gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rezia, Gulbadan!&rdquo; said Siddha, with assumed calm,
&ldquo;I know you now; you have deceived me, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>and
the man to whom I owe so much, if not everything. I come to bid you
farewell; honour commands me to go, but without flight I know that I
could not. To-morrow or to-day I leave Agra, never to see it again, nor
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a second, and before Siddha had finished, Faizi&rsquo;s wife had
comprehended all. She had, convinced that her lover had left in command
of his detachment, seen no reason why she should not openly show
herself at the great festival, nor for keeping herself veiled. Then he
must have seen and recognised her, and have heard her real name; the
affair was too plain to require any explanation, nor were questions and
explanations among her tactics. She looked at him entreatingly with her
soft blue eyes, raising her clasped hands towards him, then tottered,
and without one word sank back on the divan, hiding her face in the
cushions.</p>
<p>For some time Siddha gazed silently at her; so beautiful, so
irresistibly lovely had she never appeared to him as just in that
moment when he had determined never again to see her; and he felt that
this last look would be imprinted on his mind for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go at once,&rdquo; whispered a voice to him; &ldquo;no
words more, nor farewells, or it will be too late to escape the
enchantment, that already begins to work.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then she slowly raised her head, thrusting back the luxurious locks
that fell in waves around her, and passed her hand over her face, as
one that awakes from a deep sleep or swoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rezia,&rdquo; said Siddha, &ldquo;let me call you so once
more; I thought to leave you without one word of preparation would not
have been honourable; but do not make this parting still harder to me.
You, I trust, will agree that to part is unavoidable. Unknowingly, I
have sinned against hospitality, and repaid the truest friendship with
the grossest ingratitude. To continue doing so would be the worst of
crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, my friend,&rdquo; said Rezia, gently.
&ldquo;To part, I feel, must to you appear unavoidable. I have long
feared it, and for that reason dissembled my name; but hear me for a
few moments before you leave me for ever, for I would not that you
should remember me with contempt. Listen to what I have to say, not in
defence, but in excuse of my conduct. I deceived you, it is true, and
more than once. I began by deceiving you the first time we met. I had
seen you shortly after your arrival at Agra, though you did not see me,
and that first sight of you awoke an interest that was not diminished
by what I heard in answer to my inquiries, and then rashly I determined
to make your acquaintance, making use of that letter to Kashmir as my
pretence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>To what that acquaintance led, aided by my
weakness and love, alas! you know too well; but then, indeed, I did not
know that there was any bond of friendship between Faizi and you. And
when later on, to my horror, I discovered it, I should have had the
courage to break off all that we were to each other by confessing who I
was. But, ah! I was weak, Siddha; weak as only a woman who loves can
be, who loves the man of her choice with passionate fondness. I feared
the parting that your sense of honour would pronounce to be necessary,
and I was silent. Can you forgive me, Siddha, before we bid each other
good-bye for ever?&rdquo; And timidly, as though afraid of his anger,
she stretched out her hand to him, and sank back, slowly and wearily,
on the cushions, her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>For a time he struggled with himself a bitter and terrible battle,
but, alas! of too short duration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rezia,&rdquo; he cried, clasping in his arms the woman who
not only ruled him but forced him to forget all that honour bade him to
hold dear,&mdash;&ldquo;Rezia, without you there is neither life nor
existence, and with you no crime and no shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had indeed spoken the truth, and made use of no exaggeration when
he told her that she was dearer to him than life, and dearer than
honour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>And so the evening passed on. Siddha was partly
disturbed, partly overwhelmed with an indescribable happiness;
sometimes despising himself, and then again rejoicing in his fatal
passion. It was late before he passed down the well-known path, and was
about to open the little door in the garden wall, when, to his
astonishment, it opened, and the figure of a man passed through, who,
without remarking him, attempted to close it after him. But a sudden
exclamation from Siddha made him turn round. Who could it be? Faizi
himself perhaps. Siddha could have bitten out his tongue for his
foolish imprudence, but it was too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, in the name of Shaitan, are you doing here?&rdquo;
cried the new comer; and Siddha at once recognised the voice of Prince
Salim, whose figure was scarcely visible in the dimness of night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With an equal or a better right, I might ask that of
you,&rdquo; was the bold reply. The clatter of arms told Siddha that
the Prince had laid his hand on his sword, and he on his side did the
same. Salim approached a step or two, and recognising his opponent, let
his sword fall back into its sheath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! my friend Siddha Rama,&rdquo; he cried, in no little
astonishment, &ldquo;so we catch you in one of your nightly adventures!
Still, there is not much harm in that for a young man like you. Do not
fear that I shall betray you, nor need <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>you be jealous. You
must know that the chosen one of your heart is, to a certain degree,
mixed up in our plans, and I come occasionally to talk them over with
her in secrecy and under cover of night; but perhaps at this moment she
will be hardly inclined to discuss such dry subjects, and it will be as
well for me to put off my visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Salim turned towards the doorway, and, having let Siddha
through, carefully shut it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are now returning to your lodging? My path lies
in the opposite direction,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he added,
to Siddha, who, not knowing what to say, stood silently listening to
him, &ldquo;let this meeting remain a secret between us, it will be our
wisest course.&rdquo; And so saying, Salim disappeared in the
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has accidentally rendered me a great service,&rdquo;
muttered the Prince to himself, as he hurried on; &ldquo;he has put me
in possession of a secret that can be of inestimable worth. In all this
I recognise that snake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day one of Salim&rsquo;s most trusted men was wandering
round the country house, and before long found an opportunity of
talking with Gulbadan&rsquo;s servant. The bargain he proposed was
quickly concluded, the servant betraying her mistress&rsquo;s secrets
willingly, for the Prince, naturally, could pay more than she and
Siddha together. On the evening of the same day the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>servant presented herself at the palace, and was
received by Salim&rsquo;s confidant, to whom she gave two papers folded
in the form of letters, and hurried back to her mistress&rsquo;s abode
with the price she had received for them. The following day Salim was
on his road back to Allahabad with a small escort.</p>
<p>There sojourned one solitary and sad. For a long time Iravati had
heard nothing of her betrothed. In the beginning, shortly after his
arrival in Agra, he had, as she well remembered, written her two
letters, as overflowing as his earlier ones had been with assurances of
his love that could never be shaken; since then she had received no
letter from him, though she heard from others that he was well and
rising in favour with the Emperor. What, then, could be the reason of
his continued silence? A terrible doubt began more and more to make
itself master of her, but she strove against it, drawing fresh strength
from her faith in the word and honour of her Siddha. Once as she sat
lost in musings, idly turning over the leaves of a book that in earlier
days she had read in Kashmir with her lover, she was disturbed by the
appearance of the faithful Nipunika, who approached her with a troubled
face, first hastily and then hesitatingly, as though she doubted
whether to speak or keep silence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218"
href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to tell me?&rdquo; said Iravati. &ldquo;You
seem to be the bearer of bad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; answered the servant, &ldquo;I would that my
mouth were gagged; yet I cannot leave you in ignorance of what I have
heard. It concerns you too nearly for me to dare to keep it from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak at once, without further preface,&rdquo; said Iravati.
&ldquo;I am ready to hear what you have to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she recounted her meeting with a soldier from Agra, and what he
had told her of Siddha. At first she spoke guardedly, but ended in
repeating all that Salim had discovered about Faizi&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>The consequence of this tale was as Nipunika had feared. As though
lifeless, Iravati sat there, gazing before her; and some minutes of
silence ensued before she spoke. Then she sprang to her feet, asking,
with a passion unwonted to her, &ldquo;Who told you all this? Was it a
soldier? Speak the truth, with no shifts or excuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble lady,&rdquo; answered Nipunika, &ldquo;how should I
dare to deceive you, and what reason could I have for doing so? The man
from whom I heard what I have now repeated to you is a servant of the
Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the whole story is a lie!&rdquo; cried Iravati. &ldquo;I
understand it all now. What a contemptible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>plot!&rdquo; she added to herself; and then
turning to her servant,&mdash;&ldquo;It is well, my good Nipunika, and
I thank you for your report, which you brought, I doubt not, prompted
by the real interest you take in me. But now that I know where it comes
from I care not for it. Leave me now for the moment, and in future do
not have to do with the man who told you these tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the arrow had been better aimed than Iravati would allow,
either to herself or to her servant; and left alone, she sat for a long
time, her head leaning on her hand, thinking over the possibilities and
probabilities of what she had heard. But she felt her courage rise
again when, some time after, leaving her apartment, she met Prince
Salim in one of the galleries, whose return had not been announced to
her. It was all plain to her. No one else had invented the whole
slander in order to estrange her from Siddha; and she bent her head
coolly and half contemptuously in acknowledgment of her visitor&rsquo;s
respectful greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iravati,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you would have reason for
surprise at my return here after our last, and for me discouraging
interview, if the explanation had not been given you by what has come
to your ears through your servant, and which I could not personally
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand well,&rdquo; said Iravati, without <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>anger, but without circumlocution, &ldquo;that
you think scandal may aid you where persecution has failed; but this I
had not expected, and, above all, from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scandal!&rdquo; repeated Salim; &ldquo;that would indeed be a
contemptible manner of attaining the goal of my passionate, and for you
not injurious, wishes, and a very vain one. Of what avail would such
tales and empty gossip be? But it is different when truth is supported
by proofs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? Proofs! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the kind of proofs that the strictest judge cannot
condemn. You know Siddha&rsquo;s handwriting, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look at these letters.&rdquo; And Salim handed to her
two papers folded as letters, which Guldbadan&rsquo;s trusted servant
had stolen from her mistress and sold to him. They were hastily and
passionately written, full of every expression of love, and contained
one or two verses, written by Siddha, in which the name of the adored
Rezia was repeated several times.</p>
<p>Iravati hastily read them through, and then read and re-read them,
turning the letters round and round, looking at them from every side;
then suddenly she let them fall from her hand, and would have sunk
senseless to the ground if Salim had not supported her and placed her
on a seat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>However deeply Iravati loved, she was no weak, nervous girl. In her
veins ran the blood of an ancient and heroic race; and quickly
recovering herself, she stood before the Prince, looking him firmly in
the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fate,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is decided; for I must
confess that what I have heard is really true. Another has taken
possession of the heart that until now was mine, and mine alone. But do
not think, Prince, you who rule over everything except a woman&rsquo;s
heart, that the way to it that was closed is now opened by your
discovery; do not think that my promise is now vain because the word
that was pledged to me in return is broken. As long as mine is not
returned to me it is sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried Salim in astonishment. &ldquo;The lover
whose faithlessness is known to you, forsakes and abandons you for
another, and yet you are not free, and may not listen&mdash;I do not
say at once, but some time hence, when other memories fade at last and
disappear&mdash;to him who loves you above everything, and can lay at
your feet power and honour, such as no one else can offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salim,&rdquo; answered Iravati, gently, as she strove to
collect her thoughts; &ldquo;you do not understand me, and perhaps you
cannot do so. You do not understand us Hindu women, so different from
those to whom you are accustomed. You think that the highest happiness
for a woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>is to be the favoured Sultana of some mighty
ruler, and for many it does appear so; and you think it is enough to
convince a Hindu woman of the faithlessness of her lover, to cause her
to say farewell to all thoughts of the unworthy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our women,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;know nothing of the
temptations of greatness, where either duty or honour are concerned,
and to their husband, or, which is the same thing, their betrothed,
they remain faithful, even if their love is repaid by treachery. There
are no bounds to the loyalty of a woman to her husband; and you know,
though you may consider it only the consequence of superstition or
exaggerated feeling, with what willing enthusiasm they will throw
themselves on the burning pile that consumes the body of their dead
husbands. You must have heard of our holy legends and heroic
traditions, which describe the devotion of a wife to one unworthy of
her. Doubtless the touching adventure of Damayanti must have come to
your ears. Well, as far as in me lies, I will be another
Damayanti.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3338src" href="#xd20e3338" name=
"xd20e3338src">1</a> Siddha has deserted me, but that is because the
wicked Kali<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3341src" href="#xd20e3341" name=
"xd20e3341src">2</a> has got possession of him, and tempted him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>to evil; not he himself that has brought this
bitter sorrow to me. And when he awakes from this enchantment he will
return, another Nala, and find me pure from any spot, and acknowledge
that I knew better than he, how to watch over the honour of his
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I willingly leave you,&rdquo; said Salim, after a
moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;the happy hope of his return, however
much it grieves me. But do not flatter yourself with such expectations.
Believe me, I know the woman into whose snares he has fallen. I loved
her till I saw you, and know that she is irresistible until a purer
love conquers the passion one feels for her. Believe me, I know no more
fascinating woman, as I know none purer or nobler than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said Iravati, in answer to this declaration,
&ldquo;I implore you to grant me a favour, although it may sound
uncourteous. Leave me for the present. After all that has passed, I
feel that it is necessary to be alone. A prince, a nobleman as you are,
will not refuse me this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be,&rdquo; replied Salim, &ldquo;unworthy of the
name, if for a moment longer I misused your goodness; also I feel but
too well that further persistence is now not only useless but
prejudicial to my cause, therefore I obey your request.&rdquo; And
turning, he left the gallery with slow footsteps.</p>
<p>No sooner was he gone than Iravati&rsquo;s courage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>and
firmness forsook her, and, worn out, she sank on a seat near, and
covering her face with her hands, wept bitterly.</p>
<p>Her repose was but of short duration, the sound of approaching
footsteps made her look up in alarm, and she saw Salhana before
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; he said, in a gentler tone than she ever
remembered to have heard from him, &ldquo;I know what occupies your
thoughts and bows your head with sorrow. I have long known what you
to-day have heard. I discovered some time ago Siddha&rsquo;s
faithlessness in Agra, but concealed it until the time should come when
it would be necessary that you should know it. Now all is known to you,
and I trust that you will recognise that the respect you owe, not to
yourself alone, but to me and my house, should oblige you to banish all
thought of the man who in so shameful a manner has flung from him the
alliance with our race. No, listen to me,&rdquo; he continued, as
Iravati was about to reply. &ldquo;Believe that I feel the deepest
sympathy with you in this fatal moment; still I must not neglect to
remind you what a daughter of our noble race owes to her honour and
good name. At the same time, I will tell you, though in confidence,
what I have discovered, which, though it cannot heal the wound you have
received at once, will in the end bring consolation. A splendid future
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>awaits you, Iravati; that which every woman in
the whole of Hindustan would look upon as the most enviable lot can be
yours&mdash;Prince Salim. I suspected it some time ago, and when I gave
him the opportunity, he acknowledged all to me. Prince Salim loves you,
and asks you for his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Iravati.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it! and how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the Prince himself, this very day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refused his flattering offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Salhana, in the greatest astonishment and
anger. &ldquo;Refused! Are you out of your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe not; but I am engaged to Siddha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what has that to do with it? you are still free to
choose; you are not yet his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but, what is to me the same thing, I have sworn faith to
him, and he has not released me from my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that be. Before, this might have had weight; but now he
has himself broken faith, and so released you from your
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, perhaps, might others think, who have been brought up
with different ideas. Mine forbid me to do as you wish. And if these
opinions now stand in your way, you must blame yourself, Father, who
have had me brought up in them. Above all&mdash;I will make no secret
of it&mdash;I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>still love Siddha, in spite of all; and after
him I can never love another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no necessity for talking of love! It is enough that
Salim loves you, and that you can make use of the influence you have
over him. But this you do not choose to accept, simply from devotion to
antiquated and exaggerated habits of thought, and from a silly passion
for one unworthy of you. Think what you throw from you if you persevere
in your foolish refusal. A kingdom is offered to you, to which the
whole world can scarcely show a rival; and you throw it from you with
contempt, for the sake of a dream&mdash;a whim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that I am wrong,&rdquo; said Iravati, with forced
calmness, while her father became more and more excited; &ldquo;but
your representations cannot convince me. I have already heard them, and
still more forcibly put, from the Prince, without being shaken in my
resolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your resolution is, that you will resist your father. But it
appears to me that hardly agrees with the principles to which you are
so much devoted, and which teach that obedience from a child to a
father is one of the first duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but not when this duty comes into conflict with a
still higher one. However much it grieves me not to obey you, in this
case I may not, and I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know that a father has right over <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>his
daughter, and in cases of necessity forces her to obey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it well, but also know that here compulsion would
avail nothing. If I let myself be forced into a marriage with Salim, I
should lose all value in his eyes, and so my influence over him would
be as nothing. That he himself knows; but he will not think of force.
If he did, he would not need your intervention. Akbar&rsquo;s heir is
powerful enough to crush both your will and mine, if he
chose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salhana clenched his hands, and impatiently bit his moustache.
Beaten on all sides, and by whom? A simple girl, whom until now he had
only known as the gentlest and most submissive of daughters. All his
great plans and glittering prospects destroyed by this wilful and
stubborn child. He who had dreamt not of a viceroyship alone, but to
attain to the highest place next to the Emperor. He already saw himself
in Agra, next to the throne as Grand Wazir, ruling Prince and land
through his daughter; sovereign ruler over kingdoms and
peoples&mdash;if not in name, at least in reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he cried at last, as he placed himself in a
threatening attitude opposite Iravati; &ldquo;you will not listen to
reason, and you do not fear compulsion; but there may be something that
you fear&mdash;the curse of a father!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The sorrow that is already laid upon me would be increased
twofold,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but I would strive for courage to
bear my burden without faltering. That must happen which is written by
fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are courageous,&rdquo; said Salhana, coldly and
sarcastically; &ldquo;or you try to be so. But are you so sure that
your obstinacy will not injure this Siddha, whom you acknowledge that
you still love, and that the Prince may not avenge your refusal on
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last blow seemed to reach its aim. Iravati, in despair, lifted
her hands on high and then let them fall powerless at her side, while
her head sank on her breast. With a hateful, triumphant smile, Salhana
watched her. The victory at last was his, and the strength of the
invincible one broken.</p>
<p>But the proud girl raised her head again, and looking Salhana full
in the face, she said, first in a faltering voice, which soon became
steady:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you have said, Father, is cruel, horribly cruel, and I
can scarcely believe that you really mean it. But even should it be a
threat in earnest, it has not the power to make me forsake the sacred
duty that is laid upon me. If Siddha stood before us, and saw me
hesitate, and violate my promise to save him from danger, he would
despise me, and thrust me with good right from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>him.
My life I will sacrifice for him, for it is his; but not my honour,
that belongs also to him. His death will be mine; but what is fated we
cannot avoid. Let vengeance strike the guiltless, but neither Salim nor
you will gain anything by it. You will have lost a daughter and your
brother a son, that would be all; and your ambition would in no way be
advanced. But let us break off a conversation that may end in causing
me to lose the respect I owe you. Think, my Father, that I am your
daughter, and one of a noble and ancient race, who cannot but be
alarmed where duty or honour are concerned,&mdash;or the man I
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Salhana stood silently looking at Iravati, standing
proudly and almost defiantly before him.</p>
<p>Their positions were changed; the hitherto submissive daughter now
commanded, and forced the haughty father to subjection. Without a word,
he turned and hurried away, with a fierce expression of foiled rage on
his dark countenance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href=

<p class="first">As usual, when evening closed in, a gaily coloured
crowd thronged round the shops and houses of one of the smaller bazars
of Agra, situated on the river. Here and there dice-players sat in open
verandahs round their boards; and there passed drunken<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3434src" href="#xd20e3434" name="xd20e3434src">2</a>
soldiers armed with various weapons; a little retired from the crowd
reposed solitary opium-eaters, lost in blissful dreams; and there also
were grave Muhammadans deep in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231"
href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>earnest conversation, and
deigning for once to take a turn amongst the despised Hindus engaged in
their social pleasures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ali,&rdquo; said one of these to his companion,
&ldquo;with Akbar and his court things go from bad to worse. Evening
after evening I know that these blasphemous meetings take place.
Yesterday, about midnight, I passed by the palace, and what do you
think I saw? All the Emperor&rsquo;s windows were brilliantly lit,
sparkling with many lamps and wax tapers. But for what? For no feast
such as a prince might celebrate. No; all was still as death, excepting
a solemn song, or rather hymn. Akbar himself has, I have heard,
composed several of them; and however well they sound, they have
nothing to do with our religious service to the praise of the Great
Prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does this betoken?&rdquo; said Ali.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What it really signified,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;I
cannot exactly say; but there is no doubt but that the light and
singing were in connection with the new teaching that Akbar is trying
to introduce in the place of that of Islam, and into which he initiates
his confidants&mdash;a kind of fire and sun worship, which in an evil
hour he has taken from the ancient Parsees, and also from the
unbelievers here. May Allah have mercy on them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of religion is it?&rdquo; asked Ali. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>&ldquo;Though I have heard of it more than once,
yet I do not exactly know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I very exactly,&rdquo; replied Yusuf; &ldquo;but that
it is very bad is proved by the opposition it meets with from all the
faithful, especially from a man like Abdul Kadir, who is very learned
and much esteemed by Akbar himself. From personal experience I have
lately become acquainted with things still more disquieting than those
of which I have already told you. Not long since I saw a man steal from
the palace secretly, and as if afraid lest anyone should see him; a man
whom you must know, but whom you cannot meet without a cold shudder of
horror&mdash;Gorakh, the so-called Yogi. Now,&rdquo; continued he,
sinking the whisper in which he spoke to a still lower tone, &ldquo;do
you know for what I hold that man? If not Shaitan himself, he is
certainly his assistant; and with him Akbar has made a
compact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yusuf was silent, regarding his comrade with horror. &ldquo;Protect
us, Allah!&rdquo; he suddenly cried, pointing to a figure approaching
by the river-side; &ldquo;there he is in person! May the waters of the
Jamuna swallow him up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, in truth, there was the Durga priest, approaching a group of
Hindus and Persians engaged in lively conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I say,&rdquo; said one of these last, &ldquo;is that we
ought not, and we cannot, bear longer the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>scorn and ridicule
which is openly and continually shown to our holy religion by Faizi and
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, not to mention a still higher name; and I cannot
understand how you people&mdash;although yours may be a different
religion&mdash;how you can calmly look on at the destruction and
overthrow of what you, as well as we, must hold sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to that we have not yet come,&rdquo; said the Hindu.
&ldquo;It is well known that the Emperor and his followers do not think
much of your Koran, and perhaps as much might be said of your religion.
But so far I have heard nothing of destruction and overthrow; our
temples are untouched, and no one interferes with our religious
practices; while you Muhammadans in old days did nothing but torment
and persecute us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you well deserved, you sons of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, men, no disputes,&rdquo; said a Persian soldier,
interrupting them; &ldquo;quarrels will not aid us.&rdquo; And he gave
a sign to the angry Muhammadan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be so,&rdquo; he answered, turning his back on the
Hindu, and, accompanied by two friends, passed on his way.</p>
<p>Now Gorakh joined in the conversation: &ldquo;It was well that you
were present, Mubarak,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;open disputes may be
dangerous. Most Hindus hold to the side of the Emperor; but if for the
moment they are not to be won, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>fortune changes they
will come over to us. In the meantime what progress have you
made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greater part of our mansabdars are already won,&rdquo;
answered Mubarak; &ldquo;and they will openly declare on our side
directly the signal is given. Those that go with the army will turn
round at the right moment, and those that remain here at Agra will do
the same, and they can depend on their troopers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conversation had been listened to with eager interest by two
men who had joined the group of speakers, and to whom, by the greeting
they exchanged, they appeared to belong; but with still deeper interest
they listened when Gorakh, in a low voice, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These last days have brought some changes in our plans; we
must not wait to strike the blow until Akbar has reached the north, for
it is always possible that in spite of the desertion of part of his
troops he may gain a victory. Such reports from Kashmir would spread a
panic, and we should find that there was little or nothing we could do
here; so we must somewhat hasten matters, and put our plans into
execution when Akbar is on the road, but too far off to return to Agra
in a few days&rsquo; marches on hearing that Salim is declared Emperor
and has strengthened himself in the fortress; then there is no doubt
that the malcontents in the army will <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>turn against Akbar.
Take care, then, Mubarak, and you others, that our people are warned in
time, and hold themselves in readiness to carry out our plans, although
the time is advanced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After talking a little longer the conspirators separated, each going
his own way, and leaving the last comers together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is weighty news,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;and if I am
not mistaken it will make things easier for Akbar. How unfortunate that
we cannot at once make our report to Ab&uacute;-l Fazl; but we must
wait till night, it may be dangerous to go to his palace before then;
and also, I believe he is now with the Emperor, and we should not find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the first, &ldquo;that it will be wiser
for us now to separate; we shall meet at midnight at the house of the
Wazir.&rdquo; And greeting his companion, he turned up a side street,
while the other continued along the river-side.</p>
<p>However fearful and profane the rites may have been that were
supposed to have taken place in the private apartment of the
Emperor&mdash;leading the pious Yusuf and his followers to believe that
Akbar had concluded a compact with Shaitan&mdash;on that evening, at
any rate, a right-thinking Mussulman would have seen nothing
remarkable, though he might have taken fresh <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>offence at the conversation if he had been able
fully to understand and follow it.</p>
<p>Faizi, Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, and the Brahman Kulluka, who had but
lately returned from the north, were with the Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No further report from your spies?&rdquo; he asked his
ministers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since yesterday,&rdquo; answered Ab&uacute;-l Fazl;
&ldquo;but I expect them at midnight, and understand that they have
news for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not sad,&rdquo; said Akbar, &ldquo;that one must make
use of such people? Oh! why are men thus forcing us to have recourse to
such means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied the Minister, &ldquo;a necessary
consequence of our present form of government, which cannot be altered.
Malcontents, whether they are so with justice or not, have no means of
redressing their wrongs when all the power is vested in one, and that
one pronounces their complaints to be groundless. The ambitious and
fortune-seekers make use of them as tools to attain their own ends, and
they easily allow themselves to be so employed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never refuse to listen to the complaints of my
subjects,&rdquo; said Akbar; &ldquo;and if they are just, I redress
them as far as lies in my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are just!&rdquo; repeated Ab&uacute;-l Fazl.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>&ldquo;Yes; but who decides that? The Emperor
and his councillors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you have, then? We have heard of states and
people in other parts of the world, where things are managed
differently; but then, the condition of those people is very different
from that of ours. How would it be possible among the many kingdoms and
races subject to our rule to give any real share in the government to
the people themselves, even if their character, their manners and
customs, made it possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; said Ab&uacute;-l Fazl; &ldquo;and
I have already said that I regard further changes as neither desirable
nor possible. When I alluded to the present state of affairs, it was
only to show how unavoidable is the use of means that we are forced to
adopt in order to avoid what is still worse. So far as these men are
concerned whom we contemptuously call spies, they are less to be
despised than one supposes; at least, the two I have now in my mind are
honourable men, respected by others, and devoted to us heart and soul.
It is true that they are well paid, still that is not necessary, they
would be faithful to us without that; and they have indeed rendered us
good service. They discovered Salhana&rsquo;s plot, and, what is not of
less importance, the secret intrigues of Gorakh the Yogi.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked Faizi, mischievously, &ldquo;of that
philosopher who for some time gloried in the favour of His Majesty,
while he unfolded the mysteries of the Yogi teaching; but not much came
of it, so far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Akbar coloured as the remembrance was brought back to him how with
all his wisdom he had almost, though but for a moment, been entirely
taken in by the cunning deceiver. But at the right moment Kulluka
interposed, and continued the conversation by saying: &ldquo;It is
indeed to be regretted, but it is wiser to have little to do with this
Gorakh. My former pupil, Siddha, has communicated to me things about
him which show that caution is necessary. And yet he knows more,
perhaps by tradition, of the ancient and now almost forgotten teaching
than we shall ever discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you see,&rdquo; said Akbar, triumphantly, to Faizi,
&ldquo;that our friend Kulluka, who is so well acquainted with all the
learning of the Brahmans, does not look upon the Yogi system as so
utterly unimportant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will willingly allow that it contains much that is
valuable,&rdquo; said Faizi, &ldquo;if our wise friend says so, from
whom we have learnt so much that is worth knowing. But excuse me,
Kulluka, if I ask what it is you expect from this system of days gone
by? So far as I know, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>is nothing but a foolish
mysticism, promising an impossible absorption of the individual in the
supreme, brought about by charms and enchantment, or, to speak more
plainly, by clever feats of jugglery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think so unfavourably of the system of
Patanjali,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3530src" href="#xd20e3530"
name="xd20e3530src">3</a> answered Kulluka; &ldquo;although I do not
for a moment believe it can boast the possession of absolute truth. The
union with, and resolution of the mortal into the immortal, of human
existence into the spiritual, according to the Yogi view, is in itself
not so great a folly. But no doubt this teaching is erroneous when it
seeks, through absorption or union, to solve the mystery of the
existence of the mind of man, by which in a kind of ecstasy the mortal
is absorbed into the immortal. If this absorption were possible, it
would in truth be self-annihilation. I do not think that the
fundamental idea is to be so entirely rejected, or at least a part of
it, of which all this is the result. Is it not a truth that, just
because men find themselves so weighed down and bound within narrow
limits, their spirits know no higher exaltation than that to which they
rise in those rare moments when they lose the sense of their
personality <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>in nobler or higher and more comprehensive
ideas? Provided the ideas remain no empty abstraction, but take their
being from strong human life, from knowledge, art, and the
contemplation of the social existence of men, what, I ask, can you
place higher than so to lose the finite and self-seeking <i>I</i> in
the universal good? From the place whence the individual drew the true
spirit of life, to that place it should return if it in truth
accomplished its destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are words after my heart,&rdquo; said Akbar.
&ldquo;This same thought, that of self-denial, animates our own
philosophical systems as well as the new doctrines that these
missionaries from the West have come here to preach. But is there not
another subject to which the thoughts of men should be directed,
especially those of philosophers? However true and exalted this
doctrine of self-abnegation is, what does it tell us of the eternal
union of spirit and matter which pervades existence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; answered the Brahman; &ldquo;he would be
unworthy the name of philosopher who did not take as a chief subject of
philosophical thought the contemplation of life and morals proceeding
from it. But who will ever solve for us the enigma of life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one, certainly,&rdquo; answered Faizi; &ldquo;at least not
at present. What future knowledge, in distant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>centuries may contribute to its solution we
cannot even guess. But for the present should we not content ourselves
with the conviction, shared by all wise men, both past and present, and
expressed by many of them more or less clearly, that there is in the
universe an eternal life without end and without beginning; a life and
being through which everything is bound together or brought into union,
of which the highest law is development&mdash;the development of the
lower steps or forms of existence into those still higher. And what are
we ourselves&mdash;we men? Always the same as that which surrounds
us&mdash;a revelation of the universal being, each destined, in his own
circle and according to his powers, to take his part in the general
development. In proportion as we can clearly keep before our eyes the
higher and more universal aims, so will narrow feelings of self-love
retire to the background, making room for unselfish devotion to the
good of our fellow-men, of society, and of the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well put, my worthy Faizi,&rdquo; said Akbar; &ldquo;but
true as all that may be, does it content you? Do you not long for
something else, something more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;That one idea, in
its abstruse generalization, does not satisfy. We would understand it
more clearly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>and learn to apply it; we would strive after the
knowledge of immortal life and of the original compact by observing
their manifestations here; and to attain this knowledge all those
strive who devote themselves to philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not quite understand me,&rdquo; said the Emperor;
&ldquo;but I will allow all that you have said. What I meant was: has
the universal being, of which you speak, its origin in itself, or in
another still higher intelligence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intelligence and thought,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;are
necessary attributes of this being, as well as that which we are
accustomed to call matter or extension.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3557src" href="#xd20e3557" name="xd20e3557src">4</a> Both declare
themselves in infinite manifestations; and how is it possible that that
which is an attribute of a thing can at the same time be its
cause?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments a deep silence reigned. The Emperor sought for an
answer, but shook his head and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; at last said Ab&uacute;-l Fazl to Faizi,
&ldquo;your reasoning is perfectly logical, yet it contents me as
little as it does our venerated Emperor. What have you, and what have
we, to do with this conception of soul and matter? What can it give
us?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Faizi, smiling, &ldquo;it need give you
nothing if it is true; and if it is true, you should own it, though it
may neither content nor please you. I mean to show that my idea gives
or possesses a value in life only in so far as it awakens in us
devotion to all that we regard as good and true; and what can you ask
for more than this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; answered Ab&uacute;-l Fazl; &ldquo;but
I spoke not so much for myself and for us, as for those of less
cultivation and enlightenment, who cannot comprehend all this, and yet
seek for something more and higher than daily experience brings them.
Would it not be possible so to dress up these abstract ideas as to make
them more acceptable to the multitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend Faizi,&rdquo; said Akbar, &ldquo;now says what I
myself have often thought. If it is not possible to discover new images
or emblems for these conceptions or notions proclaimed by Faizi, can we
not receive those of ancient days which were not peculiar to solitary
and independent religious systems, but which sprang from the religious
and poetical spirit of the people themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand your meaning,&rdquo; replied Faizi, as Akbar was
silent; &ldquo;you allude, if I am not mistaken, to the new doctrine or
teaching which the Emperor wishes to introduce, and with which some of
his trusted friends are already acquainted. Is it not so?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; answered Akbar, &ldquo;you are not mistaken.
But allow me to make use of this opportunity to say something further
about it. To you Faizi, and you Kulluka, I am indebted for much
elucidation, and the turn that our conversation has taken, which gives
me the chance of expressing my meaning, is indeed welcome to me.
Listen, then. For a long time I have sought for some form in which a
rational religion might be expressed, and which would at the same time
content philosophical thinkers and those of less enlightenment. At last
in some measure I found what I sought in making acquaintance with the
images of the ancient Persians, but above all, Kulluka, of those of
your philosophical poets of old days. I mean those so well known to
you&mdash;Sun and Fire. The contemplation of the most striking
manifestations of light and warmth may at first appear empty and
worthless; but more carefully regarded, they contain an exalted truth,
which perchance the knowledge of coming centuries may, through its
results, exalt to the highest place. See,&rdquo; continued Akbar, as he
turned to the open gallery of the apartment, and pointed to the
slowly-sinking sun, &ldquo;there the glorious representation of all
light and life in this world leaves us, to return to-morrow in
sparkling glory. Earlier races regarded him as a god, and addressed
prayers and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>adoration to him; while to the wise of old he
was the exalted image of the principles of life, and the all-pervading
force that is shown in endless manifestations. For are not light and
warmth the givers of life, without which nothing could exist? In the
light of the sun, moon, and stars, the flash of lightning, and the fire
that we ourselves kindle on the hearth, we see the most common
manifestations of this force&mdash;now beneficent, and now fearful and
destructive. Everywhere is this force present&mdash;in the earth and
planets, in man and animals, in light and water&mdash;though we may not
always remark it. And if it is really thus, would it be considered as a
mere poetical fancy if we chose this force as the emblem of the unity
and the life of which, Faizi, you have just spoken? Our friend
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl is not only one with me in this, but is anxious that
I should try my new teaching, or, if you will, the teaching I have
borrowed from those of old days, among the people, and see if they
would not accept it instead of the many superstitions that are now so
general. A name was necessary to distinguish this teaching from others;
and though a name cannot express the full meaning, that of <span class=
"sc">Tauhid-i-Ilahi</span>, &lsquo;the unity of the Deity,&rsquo; did
not appear inappropriate. Ceremonies and public services are entirely
excluded, unless you can call public service a simple symbolical
adoration of the sun <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"
name="pb246">246</a>]</span>during the day and in the morning, and of
light during the night, by means of appropriate hymns. Touching
this,&rdquo; concluded the Emperor, &ldquo;I have already imparted to
you somewhat, but I have never before fully declared it to you. The
time has now arrived: tell me frankly, what is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the friends appeared willing to comply with this request
at once. At last Kulluka broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise Prince, pardon us if we are not at once ready with our
answer; your important communication requires a moment&rsquo;s thought.
In the plan declared by you there is much that is tempting, and also,
according to my humble opinion, much that is serious. The justness and
grandeur of your images, borrowed for the greater part from our old
poets and philosophers, I shall be the first to admit; but, may I ask,
is there not great danger? These symbols once introduced amongst the
people and accepted by them, would soon lose their original meaning,
and in the end would sink to nothing but an outward and mechanical
religious service. We must well consider that this same teaching, which
you wish to proclaim, once actually belonged in truth to the faith of
more than one people; and what did it become? Not only in these later
days, but in ancient times, to which you refer, doubt arose respecting
the object of worship, and then, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247"
href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>as now, many a pious mind
asked: &lsquo;He who gives life, He who gives strength; Whose command
all the bright gods revere; Whose shadow is immortality, Whose shadow
is death; who is the God to whom we shall offer our
sacrifice?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3594src" href="#xd20e3594"
name="xd20e3594src">5</a> Even then, Surya, the sun, and Agni, the
fire, did not satisfy men as emblems of the representation of life and
force; and shall a happier future await the <i>Tauhid-i-Ilahi</i> than
that of the sun and fire worship of old days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Akbar gave no reply. &ldquo;And you, Faizi,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;what is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have little or nothing,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to add
to what my worthy friend has already said. The doubt to which he
alluded, as prevailing in the days of old, has been still more clearly
expressed than in the passage quoted by him from the Vedas. Another
poet puts it still more forcibly:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Who knows,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;who knows the
secret, who proclaimed it here?</p>
<p class="line">Whence, whence this manifold creation sprang;</p>
<p class="line">The gods themselves came later into being;</p>
<p class="line">Who knows from whence this great creation sprang?</p>
<p class="line">He from whom all this great creation came,</p>
<p class="line">Whether His will created it or was mute?</p>
<p class="line">The most High Seer that is in highest heaven,</p>
<p class="line">He knows it, or perchance even He knows it
not.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3622src" href="#xd20e3622" name=
"xd20e3622src">6</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>So it seems that doubt is as ancient as religion itself. But let us
leave that on one side, and also the hate and opposition that a
reformer must always expect from his contemporaries, the appearance of
which we may already remark here and there where the new teaching has
already been made known to the people. This an Akbar will not fear. But
there is another danger that Kulluka referred to, which cannot be put
so lightly on one side: the danger that a name once given, whether it
be Allah or another, may become a personality to the uncultured, and be
regarded as a personal representation, distinct from the Immortal
Being; and then, naturally, all is at an end with your object&mdash;the
unity of the Deity. And what will you have introduced, and what perhaps
will you have made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Faizi,&rdquo; asked Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, &ldquo;what would
you do to make the people wiser and more reasonable? How would you
bring about this reformation of ideas that the Emperor
desires?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great philosophers,&rdquo; was Faizi&rsquo;s answer,
&ldquo;of China, and all great civilisers have long ceased to profess
any religion; but they have made a real beginning as regards the
cultivation and the enlightenment of the people, and one which we have
too much lost sight of. This is, above all things, the education of the
people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>There is the only, but perfectly certain means.
It is true that the results do not soon appear; but those who put their
hands to a great work seldom see the end, which surely comes at last;
while each announcement of a new teaching, whether supported by the
authority of revelation or not, though for a time it may flourish, in
the end is sure to degenerate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be much truth in what you have said,&rdquo;
was Akbar&rsquo;s answer; &ldquo;and I will take it all into my most
serious consideration. It may perhaps be best to restrict the new
teaching to the circle of our own friends, in case we find its
introduction among the people to be opposed by insurmountable
difficulties. Still you will not expect that I should at once give up
my favourite project. We will talk it over again. But enough for
to-day; state affairs now call for our attention. I thank you, my
friends, for all you have said: you, Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, for the support
you have lent me; and you, too, for your frank and well-meant
opposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having taken leave of the Emperor, Ab&uacute;-l Fazl returned
to his palace, accompanied by his friends, to receive in their presence
the report of the two spies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Assassination.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was on a bright fresh morning when Siddha,
accompanied by two horsemen, took his way to Fathp&uacute;r, charged
with the delivery of some letters, too important to be trusted to the
hands of an ordinary messenger. The sun shone brightly, but its beams
did not burn. In the trees sang many coloured birds, and squirrels and
small monkeys sprang from bough to bough. All nature seemed awake and
full of joy; and even the peasants met with on the road had exchanged
their usual heavy tread for a lighter one, as if they also shared in
the joy that reigned around.</p>
<p>But Siddha, once so full of mirth and hope, took no part in it.
Sombre and lost in thought, he rode on silently, followed by his
attendants. He seemed, indeed, another man from what he was when he
first arrived in Agra and joked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251"
href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>with Parviz and his friends,
listening with sympathy to the confidence of the former about the noble
daughter of the Treasurer. With surprise Parviz had remarked the
change, though discretion withheld him from making any inquiries; and
still more deeply did Siddha himself feel how different all with him
now was. How different from the day when Kulluka had seen him spring
forward gracefully on his steed, as though he would conquer the world,
calling on the loved name of his future bride! How different when a
single kiss from Iravati was bliss to him&mdash;before he had learned
to long for the passionate embraces of a Rezia&mdash;when his
conscience was pure, and he had no cause for shame in having made
himself guilty of treachery, faithlessness, and ingratitude! Sombre
indeed were his reflections, for now more than ever suspicion crossed
his thoughts. Was Rezia really faithful to him, or did she only treat
him as she did her husband, who, far more than he, deserved her love?
In truth, did Salim only come to her for state reasons, or were there
other motives for his visits? And then the conspiracy, in which Siddha
had become more and more entangled. Now that he thought it over it
began to assume quite another character; it was not entirely for the
defence of his fatherland, but appeared to be directed to very
different ends. And had not Rezia, on her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>own confession,
deceived him more than once? and what reason had he now for believing
that this time she indeed spoke the truth? Into what new entanglement
had he now fallen? and for the perpetration of what crime did he allow
himself to be used as a tool?</p>
<p>An exclamation from one of his troopers awoke him from his
reflections, and looking in the direction to which the soldier pointed
with his lance, he saw in the distance a group of horsemen engaged in
combat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; cried Siddha, putting spurs to his horse; and
followed by his companions at full gallop, he turned towards the
combatants. As he approached, to his astonishment and alarm, he
recognised Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, and in the man who sought to cut him down
with his sabre Nara Singh, a Raja whom he had met more than once with
Prince Salim. Directly the Raja&rsquo;s followers caught sight of the
new comers, a detachment rode to encounter them. Siddha attacked the
leading man of the troop, who soon lay with his horse on the ground,
pierced by Siddha&rsquo;s lance. He then drew his sword, and with one
blow emptied another saddle. He had harder work with the third, who was
an accomplished soldier, and well acquainted with the use of the sword;
and while the two troopers were busy with their opponents, others came
riding up to the assistance of their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>comrades. The affair
began to look very critical for our three, when Siddha by a fortunate
blow placed his enemy <i>hors de combat</i>, and was just ready to
receive the new comer, when the retreat was sounded, and they at once
turned bridle; but at the same moment that he had felled his opponent
and seen the others hurrying up, Siddha beheld Ab&uacute;-l Fazl throw
up his arms into the air, letting his sabre fall, and then sink from
his horse to the ground. The next moment Nara Singh had called off his
soldiers and retreated at a gallop over the plain. Siddha&rsquo;s first
impulse was to pursue the murderers; but on second thoughts he saw that
he, with his two men, one of whom was wounded, could do little, while
the Minister&rsquo;s four servants lay stretched out dead on the field,
and Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, above all, required his aid.</p>
<p>Springing from his horse, and flinging the reins to one of his
followers, he knelt by the side of the wounded man, and loosing his
clothes, sought to staunch the blood that flowed from a deep wound in
his chest. To his joy Ab&uacute;-l Fazl opened his eyes, and recognised
him; but his joy was of short duration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your help, my brave Siddha, comes too late,&rdquo; he said,
in a faint voice; &ldquo;my work for the Emperor and his kingdom is
over. One last command I give you: if you suspect who the murderer is,
keep his name from Akbar.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nara Singh,&rdquo; answered Siddha, &ldquo;was, I see
clearly, only a hireling; the real murderer is&mdash;&rdquo; and here
he hesitated to say the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salim,&rdquo; continued Ab&uacute;-l Fazl; &ldquo;I had
already been warned against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exhausted, the dying man sank back in Siddha&rsquo;s arms; but
shortly after, consciousness returned, and he found the strength,
though his voice was scarcely audible, to send a last greeting to his
imperial friend, whom he had so faithfully served all his life.
&ldquo;Say to Akbar that my last thought was of him, and tell him I die
in the firm conviction of the truth of those principles of which we
have so often spoken, and so lately as yesterday. The glory of the sun
I shall hardly see more, though I feel that the light still lives in
me, but that also will be soon extinguished. I do not complain; I
believe that I have been in a position to do some good to my
fellow-men, though less than I wished, and so I die content. Strive, my
young friend, so to live, that you may one day say the same. And now
farewell,&rdquo; whispered the Wazir, after a short pause, gently
pressing Siddha&rsquo;s hand. His head sank on his breast, and Siddha
soon felt that his arm only supported a corpse.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3678src" href="#xd20e3678" name="xd20e3678src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>At about the same time, but far away from this spot, another drama
was being played, which, though in some respects different from the
tragedy of the Wazir, in others resembled it closely. Among the
mountains of the Him&aacute;layas, especially near Badari-natha, a
burning heat had for some time reigned. At evening, the beneficent
heavenly time, dark rain-clouds appeared, promising drink to the
thirsty earth, but they were again driven away by the evil Vritra, the
dark demon; and the next day the burning rays of the sun returned to
dry up and parch all vegetation. At last the mighty Indra, monarch of
the heavens, rose up and prepared himself for the strife. Again at
evening the clouds gathered, and again the demon strove to disperse
them; then Indra seized his lightning, and flung it among the mountains
with so mighty a blow that it re-echoed, rattling and thundering from
all sides. Vritra felt the stroke, but would not at once abandon the
combat, and only a few heavy rain-drops fell here and there on
languishing nature. Again fell the mighty blow, while the mountain tops
and valleys were lighted by one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>dazzling blaze; gigantic
trees were cleft in two, and heavy masses of rock were flung down into
the ravines. Then the rain fell heavily, and brooks and mountain
streams began to swell and rush downwards to the valleys. At last the
fearful battle was over, rain ceased to fall, lightning flickered
through the twilight, and no sound broke the silence except the rushing
of waters.</p>
<p>Then Gurupada, the hermit, left his dwelling, to enjoy the fresh air
laden with fragrance. He seated himself beneath his verandah, overgrown
with roses and jasmine. He sat there enjoying the peace of nature and
the new life which the refreshing rain had called forth; while he
thought of the ancient epic of the clouds, with Indra the slayer of
Vritra<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3691src" href="#xd20e3691" name=
"xd20e3691src">2</a> as its hero, which floated before his mind, as if
it had been a poem of yesterday. Then sombre and disquieting thoughts
forced themselves upon him. The accounts that Kulluka had lately
brought from Kashmir and Agra filled him with anxiety respecting the
future of his dearly-loved <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>country. &ldquo;And so,&rdquo;
said he to himself, &ldquo;it must in the end come to what I have so
long feared, and hoped to have averted by many years of self-inflicted
banishment. A strange ruler is on the point of seizing on our unhappy
country, and the road is smoothed to him by our own fatal disunion. He
is right from his point of view: he must restore order in a
neighbouring State when the anarchy continually causes disturbances in
his own empire; and if this cannot be accomplished while the
independence of that country is respected, then must it be forced to
subjection. But is there in truth nothing that can be done? No,
no,&rdquo; continued he. &ldquo;Kulluka&rsquo;s proposal that I should
return, and, perhaps supported by Akbar, take the government from the
hands of my weak brother&mdash;no, that would not do. My return would
only be a temporary remedy, even if it were that. And I have become too
old and unpractised in the art of ruling again to reign, and, above
all, there, where youth and energy are required. Life cannot last much
longer; I am weary and long for rest; I have long sighed for union with
the immortal Brahma, whence we take our short independent existence,
and to which we shall return again.&rdquo; And Gurupada slowly closed
his eyes as he stretched himself upon a soft bed of fresh moss. A flash
of lightning, that for a moment lit up the valley and all around,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>awoke and called him back for a few moments to
his reflections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps it is as well that things should indeed go as
they seem fated to do. A renewed party warfare, of which the end can
never be foreseen, would impoverish our people, and bring our country
to ruin. But should it be subjected to a wise and just government, its
industries and commerce would revive, and its former prosperity return.
Akbar is a prince who knows how to make his subjects happy; and to-day
many people bless him who formerly resisted his rule. Yet it is hard
for a country to see itself deprived of a liberty which has been its
boast for centuries. Ah, that it might be spared me to see this happen
to my own country!&rdquo; So saying, he laid his head down again, with
a sigh, and, half listening to the rushing of the brook, fell into a
light slumber. All seemed in the deepest rest far and near; there was
nothing to disturb the old man&rsquo;s sleep, except that every now and
then he became aware of the humming of an insect, and felt it brush his
cheek gently; and then a strange, unaccountable feeling crossed him
that he was not alone. Again he looked up, but could see nothing, and
even the insect seemed to be driven away by his sudden movement. In a
short time it returned, then flew away, and again returned, until the
sleeping man took no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259"
name="pb259">259</a>]</span>further notice of it, and gave himself up
entirely to slumber. This was not so heavy but that the slightest cause
would again awaken him. Suddenly he put one hand to his neck and seized
a cord that had been flung round it; with the other he felt around him,
and touched a cold, slippery body that had been rubbed with oil. Having
freed himself from the cord, he seized his assailant with both hands,
but in vain; he slipped through his fingers and appeared to escape. The
stillness of night was broken by a sharp cry, answered by a growl, and
close by Gurupada saw two fiery balls gleam. In another moment a flash
of lightning showed him his tiger Hara, with its powerful claws fixed
in the body of a man who lay stretched on the ground.</p>
<p>At the sound of this cry the servant hurried from the house with a
torch, the light of which showed Gurupada that his sight had not
deceived him; and he at once understood what had happened. The man that
lay there had attempted to strangle him; but, just in time, he had felt
the cord; and the tiger, driven by some instinct, had followed the Thug
as unobserved as he himself had approached the hermit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back! Hara,&rdquo; cried Gurupada, springing forward and
seizing the tiger by the neck; &ldquo;back, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the animal would not move, and then, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>slowly and unwillingly obeying the voice of its
master, it drew out its claws, and retreated growling, for a few paces,
and laid itself down.</p>
<p>With the help of the servant, the hermit lifted the fallen man from
the ground, where a blow from the tiger&rsquo;s paw had laid him; and
finding that life still lingered, they placed him carefully on the
moss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this man,&rdquo; said Gurupada, after having closely
examined him. &ldquo;In the days of my power I showed him many favours
and benefits. What could have driven him to this treacherous
attack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words, the wounded man looked up, and gazed
attentively and earnestly at the hermit; then murmured, with
astonishment, &ldquo;Nandigupta! is it possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nandigupta, in truth,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;What
induced you to seek my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord and prince,&rdquo; said the Thug, with a firm voice,
&ldquo;I swear to you by Siva and his holy consort that I knew not who
you were, and had long thought you dead. Had I known it, I should never
have had the strength or courage to fulfil the behest of Durga, however
great the punishment of her anger might have been. But, happily, she
herself did not desire your death, and sent this tiger to take my life
in the place of yours. Blessed be her name!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>Exhaustion prevented his saying more. With the servant&rsquo;s help,
Gurupada washed and bound, as well as was possible, the terrible wound
caused by the tiger&rsquo;s claws, and having given him drink, and
seeing he began to recover a little, Gurupada asked further,
&ldquo;What drove you to this deed? and if you did not know who I was,
who told you that Durga desired my death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorakh the Yogi,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! the villain!&rdquo; murmured Gurupada; &ldquo;then there
must be more behind. So you have become a Thug,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;I am sorry to see you so led away and blinded. Was I the only
one pointed out to you by Gorakh as a chosen sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pain for a few minutes hindered the wounded man from replying,
though his countenance betrayed nothing of what he was suffering. At
last he answered and spoke very steadily, with pauses between his
words, &ldquo;The First Minister of Kashmir, Salhana&rsquo;s brother,
is also chosen; but his death is entrusted to my brother, who is also
well known to you. Should he fail, then I am to carry it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has your brother started for Kashmir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left me yesterday a little distance from here, and took
his way towards the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On foot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Are any others acquainted with these orders respecting the
Minister and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one else knows. Only when it is known that we have failed
will the task be entrusted to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gurupada signed to his servant, and went on one side with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and saddle your horse at once. You
must instantly set off on a journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low, suppressed groan called him back to the side of the wounded
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I have only a few minutes
to live; and I ask you to add one more favour to the many I have
enjoyed at your hands: say that you forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgive you, unhappy man,&rdquo; answered Gurupada;
&ldquo;I know you were nothing but a tool in the hands of
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I die happy, and with a foretaste of bliss enter into
immortal life, assured of the grace of the goddess both to you and me,
through the wonder she has worked in receiving me as a sacrifice in
your place. Holy Trinity, holy Durga!&rdquo; cried he, in a louder
voice, and stretching out his arms as though animated with fresh
strength; &ldquo;receive me into the temple of your glory! I
come!&rdquo; With these words he fell back motionless, and the faithful
follower of the Goddess of Destruction was no more. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>For some time the hermit remained gazing at the lifeless body, to
which, in the wavering light, its emaciation, dark colour, and forehead
marked with the red and white symbols of Siva, gave a ghostly
aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;cannot religion or
fanaticism lead! it turns otherwise good and quiet people into
criminals, murderers, and mad-men. Still this man is in no way to be
pitied; he died as a martyr, in the full conviction of being received
into endless happiness. But the hypocrites, the shameless villains,
such as Gorakh, who make use of such simple souls as tools wherewith to
execute their accursed plans, what of them? What do they deserve but a
war of destruction? Yet no,&rdquo; he continued, shaking his head,
&ldquo;that would not be right. No mercy where a crime has been
committed or attempted; but no persecution when it is only threatened.
Who can place the limit where a religious sect becomes dangerous, and
where it is not?&rdquo; Here the return of the servant interrupted his
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to carry this man who lies
here. He is dead, but I do not wish that Hara should devour him, which
otherwise he certainly will do; and when we have finished, then to
horse. Hasten you to Kashmir, to warn the Minister of what we have
learnt; and endeavour to trace out the brother of this man, whom you
well know. Seek <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264</a>]</span>to hinder him in his undertaking, and to
prevent his communicating with any of his associates. If you can, also
discover where Gorakh is; do not spare him for a moment: the wretch
doubly deserves the cord he prepares for the necks of
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, honoured master,&rdquo; asked the servant, with
hesitation, &ldquo;must I leave you entirely alone here in the
wilderness? It seems that your place of refuge is now discovered, and
there may be fresh attempts on your life. Must I leave you, just at
this moment when I might be of service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best friend,&rdquo; answered Gurupada, smiling, &ldquo;do
not disturb yourself about me. What is my life in comparison with the
greater interests that depend on the speedy execution of your mission?
I am here as safe as with you for my guard, at least as long as Hara
lives. You have seen how brave a guard he is. I would not advise any
more of these marauders to show themselves in the neighbourhood. Hara
now knows those kind of people, and is not inclined to allow them to
come here in peace. Is your horse ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, quickly away. First, help me with our work here.&rdquo;

Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, in 1598, was sent by Akbar to the Dakhin. Salim
broke out in rebellion; and the Emperor, in his trouble, sent for his
trusty Minister. Ab&uacute;-l Fazl hastened to rejoin his master. But
Salim, who had always hated the Minister, instigated a Rajp&uacute;t
chief of Bandalkhand, named Bir Singh of Urchah, to waylay him.
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl was murdered near Narwar, on the 12th of August 1602,
and Bir Singh fled from the wrath of Akbar, leading the life of an
outlaw in the jungle until the death of the great Emperor.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tidings of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl&rsquo;s death had
made an overwhelming impression on the Emperor. It seemed to him as if
everything that had until now been his support was suddenly failing
him. He who had been so strong, who had never known faint-heartedness
when threatened by the fiercest storms, who had braved the greatest
dangers, and had always come back victor from the strife, now felt his
strength crippled, and as though he were almost powerless among the
many disturbances that were again breaking out in his empire. All he
was capable of in those first days was to order the arrest of Nara
Singh, the murderer; but this order it was impossible to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>carry out, as the Raja had fled and found a safe
refuge far away, to await the time when Salim should ascend the throne
and load him with favours. However, it was not possible that a man of
Akbar&rsquo;s character could remain bowed down under the burden of
sorrow, however heavy it might be. For some days he shut himself up
entirely, and admitted no one except Faizi and some of his most trusted
friends; but with time courage returned to him to receive others who
sought audience either respecting their own affairs or those of the
state. Among these was Padre Aquaviva, who, before his departure,
wished to take a personal leave of the Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are going to leave us again, worthy Father?&rdquo;
said Akbar, as the Jesuit was ushered into his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do so, Sire,&rdquo; answered Aquaviva; &ldquo;our
Provincial summons me back to Goa. But I cannot depart without
expressing to your Majesty my heartiest thanks for the honour and
favours that have here been shown us, though I hesitated to ask an
audience after your serious and bitter loss. A worthy man, a true
friend, and a faithful servant was Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, and the memory of
such a man is certainly a comfort in the midst of the sorrow that his
loss causes. But,&rdquo; added he, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
&ldquo;this would not be to me a sufficient consolation.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough!&rdquo; repeated Akbar in surprise. &ldquo;What
more would you demand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should wish for the certainty that he died with a purer
soul, and with happier expectations than was possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ab&uacute;-l Fazl,&rdquo; answered the Emperor, in an earnest
but calm voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Ab&uacute;-l Fazl was as pure of soul as
any of yours can be, without saying more, and he died as I would wish
to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jesuit waited, expecting Akbar would add something more, but he
was silent; and the tone of his reply clearly showed that to ask for
further explanation would be imprudent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect to return soon?&rdquo; asked Akbar, after a few
minutes silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will depend on the orders I receive,&rdquo; answered
Aquaviva. &ldquo;So far as I am myself concerned, with sorrow I am
compelled to confess that my mission here has been a
failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How a failure? Have you not received here the fullest
protection, and been shown all respect and fitting honour? and have you
not enjoyed the most complete liberty to preach what you will, and to
convert whom you can? Do you reckon that as nothing? Here, where a few
years ago, under my predecessors, any preaching of your doctrines would
have met with the punishment of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered the Padre, &ldquo;we should
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>indeed be ungrateful did we reckon such
important privileges as nothing. Yet I must repeat that our mission is
a failure as respects its principal object. You know well with what
glorious hopes we came to Agra; the reverent interest you took in our
holy writings, and in the ceremonials of our Church, had filled us with
hope that in the end the light of truth would sink into your noble
heart and deep-thinking mind; we had hoped, and almost expected with
certainty, that the Church of Christ would greet in Shah Akbar one of,
if not the most famous of her sons. These hopes and expectations we
cannot now flatter ourselves were anything but idle; so, cannot we say
with truth that our mission has failed in its highest aim? Still, it
may be that here and there in our teaching there are difficulties which
your philosophers cannot now solve, which closer study and research
will throw light upon. I think of the great benefits that the Church
has showered upon the West, and which would not here be wanting did she
possess like power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With reason,&rdquo; said Akbar, &ldquo;you now leave on one
side the real dogmatical questions, for about them we shall never
agree, and for the moment I feel no inclination for their discussion.
You speak of benefits; I believe, willingly and with reason, that your
Christian doctrines have done much for the world&mdash;more, perhaps,
than any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>other religion&mdash;in the application of the
principles of universal love of our fellow-men, and self-sacrifice;
however, as we have already shown you, this is not exclusively taught
by your doctrines, which, if they have done much good, have also done
much that is evil. Have you not introduced the greatest intolerance
that the world has ever known? Have not you, you priests, in the West
exalted yourselves to tyrannize over the consciences of your
fellow-men? Have you not doomed hundreds and thousands to the stake
because they differed from you on some point of faith? And you call
these benefits! Then, indeed, you have strange ideas of doing good; and
your love for your fellow-men is of a strange kind. Tell me,&rdquo; he
continued, turning a penetrating look on Aquaviva, &ldquo;tell me, how
would you treat me, Akbar, whom you now honour so highly, were I a
Christian subject of one of the princes who obey your commands? Would
you not thrust me into a dungeon, and, if I remained hardened in my
unbelief, deliver me to a judge to be condemned to the fire and
stake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perplexed, the Jesuit drew back. Such a question he had not
expected; and what could he reply? Certainly it could not be denied
that in all probability Akbar would be so treated were he in the
situation he imagined. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=
"#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; at last he stammered, &ldquo;that is not the
case; and how can Akbar, the mighty Emperor of Hindustan, think of
himself as the subject of one of our princes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it is not so, fortunately for me! but your answer
shows that my hypothesis was well grounded. Now another question: what
would you do with me, Emperor of Hindustan, as I am? You wish me to be
as one of your princes, who are submissive to your orders, and to use
me as a tool for the maintenance of your clerical tyranny. Naturally
you are very anxious for my conversion. Well, I tell you, once for all,
you will never see it; not even if I entirely accepted your
Evangelists, and were really publicly or privately to embrace them. I
could have nothing to do with your present Church, well knowing what
fatal consequences to a State would follow on its monarch taking such a
step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Aquaviva, &ldquo;nothing remains to us but
to pray to our Lord that He by a miracle will bring about that which
our zealous and feeble efforts have been unable to accomplish. And this
prayer, I feel certain, will not remain unanswered. Reflect, O powerful
ruler, that against Him the great of the earth are as nothing, and that
He can punish those who withstand Him. He, and He alone, will triumph,
and the gates of hell will avail nothing against the rock of Peter,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>while Christ and His Church will endure until
the end of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be your affair,&rdquo; cried Akbar, losing a little
of his usual patience; &ldquo;mine is to watch over the liberty and
rights of my people, and to defend them against you, as against the
mullahs or priests of any other creeds. Remain here, or go, as it best
pleases you; preach as seems good to you, and build churches. You shall
enjoy the same privileges as Muhammadans in their mosques and Hindus in
their temples. There is, however, one warning which I must give you:
the moment I find you attempt to introduce any persecution amongst your
converts or others, as already has been the case on the coast of
Malabar, that moment shall you be banished from my kingdom, never to
set your foot within it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With suppressed wrath Loyola&rsquo;s follower listened to these
proud words; but what could he do, what could he say? He had no
complaint to bring against this invariably tolerant prince, and to defy
the formidable monarch would have been sheer madness. Nor would there
have been a martyr&rsquo;s crown to gain by doing so. If he, a helpless
missionary, were to use threatening and injurious language, the Emperor
would not harm a hair of his head,&mdash;only send him and his to
Surat,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3827src" href="#xd20e3827" name=
"xd20e3827src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272"
name="pb272">272</a>]</span>and from thence in a ship to Goa, where he
would be landed with the utmost courtesy. Perhaps he would not even
take that trouble, but simply laugh, &ldquo;I have the door, show it
him.&rdquo; Miserable and ignominious situation for a member of that
order elsewhere so powerful and so feared, before whom the people
trembled, and princes and popes were forced to bow their heads in
submission!</p>
<p>Akbar interrupted the reflections of the disappointed and silent
missionary. &ldquo;Worthy Father,&rdquo; he said, in his usual friendly
tone, &ldquo;it indeed grieves me to be obliged to speak with so much
frankness and harshness in maintaining my authority in the combat you
have yourself invited; and I do not wish to see you depart in anger. I
have learnt much from you and yours, the knowledge of which was very
welcome to me, and for that I am grateful. If I cannot fulfil your
wishes, believe that it grieves me; and if on some points we differ
from each other, do not imagine that causes me to respect you less
highly. If you will leave us, so be it; but let us part in friendship.
Let our parting be in the spirit of the noble Founder of your religion,
who said well, that He came not to bring peace but a sword, and yet
strove to lay the foundation of a kingdom of peace and love amongst
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Aquaviva a few moments before had bent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>his
head before the might of the Emperor, another power now subdued him,
that of Akbar&rsquo;s moral greatness. The religious fanatic, the
passionate zealot, himself felt this, and it was with a trembling voice
that the defiant, fearless apostle spoke a few words of farewell to him
who stood there obdurate of heart, his eye blinded to the light of
truth, and his ear deaf to the warnings of the one Holy Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive us, noble prince,&rdquo; he said, moved in spite of
himself, &ldquo;if we have said what was displeasing to you, and seemed
ungrateful for the many benefits we have received in your kingdom, or
at your hands. Ascribe it to the fervour for our faith which animates
us, and which is certainly not less strong than the enthusiasm which
leads you to devote your life to the welfare of your people. Though you
may yourself set no value on our prayers, yet be assured wherever we
may go they will always be offered up for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently Akbar returned the reverent greeting of the Padre, as he
slowly left the room, his fingers moving nervously, as if he were
telling his beads.</p>
<p>In one of the passages of the palace, where a single lamp shed a
dim, uncertain light, he suddenly stumbled against a man, who answered
his excuses by a suppressed curse. &ldquo;Cursed Christian dog,&rdquo;
he muttered, as he hurried on. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274"
href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>was Abdul Kadir Badaoni, who
was on his way to the Emperor, into whose presence he was ushered by
servants, and who greeted him by saying, &ldquo;You see I am always
ready to speak with you. I made no difficulty about receiving you when
this morning you requested an audience, although the sad circumstances
in which I am placed have caused me to see but little of my friends in
these last days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; began Abdul Kadir, with apparent respect, but in
a tone of <span class="corr" id="xd20e3849" title=
"Source: unmistakeable">unmistakable</span> anger, and without paying
the least attention to the friendly manner in which the Emperor had
received him, &ldquo;I come to bid you farewell; the time of my
departure draws near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You also, my worthy friend?&rdquo; asked Akbar. &ldquo;And
what obliges you to leave us so suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unwillingness,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;to remain here
and witness what is to me a daily scandal, and grieves me to the soul;
and unwillingness, also, to take part in the treachery and conspiracies
with which I see you surrounded, and in which, against my own wishes, I
must share were I to linger here. Akbar, your empire approaches its
fall! I warned you, when yet there was time, to save yourself; now,
perhaps, that time is passed. I know not what is decided on, and I do
not wish to know. The resistance you have aroused by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>your
foolish and criminal scorn of our holy religion is, I consider, too
powerful to be turned aside. Think of the ambition of Salim your son,
and the secret alliance of other and not less ambitious people, who
know how to lead him away, so that they may become masters of the rank
and appointments now withheld from them. Think of all this, and you
will agree with me that the state of affairs is at best extremely
threatening to the continuance of your reign; but, as I said,&rdquo; he
continued, not remarking the slight smiles that his dark forebodings
had called forth on the lips of the Emperor, &ldquo;I will not remain
to be a daily witness of what here occurs, and is talked of far and
wide. The holy Koran you have scorned and trampled under foot; you
deride the great Prophet; you indulge in godless practices, learned
from impious fire-worshippers; you receive openly at court, and
privately in your own apartments, our bitterest foes&mdash;the Jews and
Christians&mdash;you treat them with honour and load them with
favours&mdash;such a one I have just seen leaving your palace; you
receive Indian charmers and magicians, and all such people as Shaitan
himself has sent here. In truth, Jalalu-d&iacute;n Muhammad, you do
honour to your name! Jalalu-d&iacute;n, the glory of faith! Bitter
irony of destiny that gave you such a title, which you were destined to
insult in so shameful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>a manner. And now, again, as if
all that were not enough, as if you would fill up the full measure,
see, see the exaggerated honours paid to the memory of this
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl, this arch enemy of the true faith! He, with his
brother Faizi, the denier of God, tempted you to this injustice and to
the desertion of our holy religion; and this is the man whom you
publicly honour and exalt above all. If his life was no warning to you,
then may his death be so before it is too late. You have been told,
doubtless, all that was beautiful about his last moments; but believe
me that the truth has been withheld from you. I, however much it may
cost me, will draw back the veil, and tell you how Ab&uacute;-l Fazl
died. Hear, and shudder at the terrible account which is known to
everyone excepting yourself. As long as speech was left to him,
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl did not cease to blaspheme his God in a manner to
awaken horror in all who heard him; then he began to yelp or bark like
a dog; his features were contorted and his lips blue, as though he
already felt the first pangs of that eternal punishment that awaited
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are lies, shameful lies!&rdquo; cried Akbar, suddenly
awakening from the composure with which, until now, he had listened to
the fanatic&rsquo;s ravings. &ldquo;Shameful scandal, of which you
religious zealots are alone capable, when you leave reason in the lurch
and seek to throw blemishes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>on a noble character. How
Ab&uacute;-l Fazl died, and what were his dying words, I know from one
I can trust; therefore spare me your idle inventions. I will not hear
them. I have listened patiently to the insolent words you have dared to
use towards me; I have shown you an indulgence that perhaps no prince
in my place would have done, and you have misused it, which I will not
suffer. Attack me, insult my dearest convictions, revile me, Akbar your
Emperor,&mdash;it is well; all that I will pardon. But do not
calumniate my truest and treacherously murdered friend, or I will make
use of my power to silence for ever the tongue that has attacked in so
cowardly a manner a hated opponent who can no longer defend
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my head,&rdquo; said Abdul Kadir, as, undismayed, he
looked the Emperor in the face. &ldquo;You know that I have ever
desired to give my life for you. If my death can do you no service, it
may at least appease your unjust wrath. I have said what I believed to
be the truth, whether you believe it or not. I did my duty, and you can
do yours, or what you are pleased to consider as such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Akbar, recovering from his indignation;
&ldquo;I desire your life as little as your death. Go hence unharmed,
but do not dare ever again to come into my presence.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>Without a word of greeting, Abdul Kadir turned round, and with a
proud and defiant look strode towards the door; but as he laid his hand
on the curtain that hung before it, the Emperor called him by his name,
and the proud Muhammadan turned round in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abdul Kadir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not let us part so. We
have known each other too long, and learnt to respect each other too
highly, to part in such a manner. For I know, in spite of our
difference, your respect and esteem are mine&mdash;even your vehemence
proves it; and I, on my side, do not only look upon you as a learned
and wise, but as a brave and honourable man, which in these days is of
far greater value. I would not willingly see any one leave me in anger,
and you least of all. Go; I understand that it is necessary you should
do so, and that it cannot be otherwise; but do not go with wrath in
your heart: think on the long years that we have passed together in
peace and friendship, and forget the cause that makes our parting
unavoidable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Akbar began to speak, Abdul Kadir&rsquo;s countenance still
retained its defiant expression; but by degrees this softened at the
generous words of the forgiving prince, and though he said nothing, his
whole bearing spoke, as Akbar held out his hand. He grasped it warmly,
and a tear fell on it as he bent his head. Then he turned and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>went, never to return, for he also was one of
those whom the Emperor would see no more. Akbar remained for some time
gazing towards the curtain that had closed behind his friend of former
years. At last, with faltering step he approached the open gallery, and
gazed out on the gardens, with their softly falling fountains, lying in
profound peace under the silvery moonlight. Then, wearied out, he sank
on one of the marble seats, and covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>Thus, they all forsook him one after another: Ab&uacute;-l Fazl
cruelly torn from him, the Christian missionaries departing in anger,
and now Abdul Kadir bade him farewell for ever; and all this happened
in the moment when, above all, he needed the support of true
friends&mdash;in the midst of dangers and difficulties, when even his
own son rose against him, and strove to wrench from his hands the
sceptre he had so long wielded for the prosperity and welfare of his
subjects. And all this for the sake of religion! For that Salim took up
arms in the name of the true faith was certain; and it was generally
believed that Nara Singh had been a tool in the hands of religious
fanatics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religion,&rdquo; said Akbar to himself, &ldquo;what is it,
then? Is it a blessing bringing peace and joy to the soul of man,
showing him his utter nothingness, leading him to humility and
adoration, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>and awakening in him the love of his fellow-man,
and the desire to live for the good of others? Or is it a fatal thing,
making man prouder, more overbearing to others, the deeper his
convictions are rooted; a madness that at times masters the greatest
and noblest, forcing them to hate and curse, and that brings crime,
murder, and bloody strife amongst the people? Would it be fortunate, or
unfortunate, should the human race with one consent cease to possess
any religion? Unanswerable question! Full of the greatest
contradiction, and yet to which every one would be ready to reply
without thought. Without religious worship all are agreed that there
can be no salvation for man, no order in society. But when the question
of the choice of a religion arises, at once the flames of conflict
break out; and each man cries &lsquo;Mine, and mine alone!&rsquo;
Swords leap from their scabbards, and steel and violence are to decide
what is truth. Is it possible that some day a religious system may
arise that will content all, and unite the human race in one bond of
love? Were they idle and foolish dreams with which I flattered myself
when I believed that I had found it? Alas! it is hard to lose friends,
but harder to lose cherished illusions that are dearer
still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hand laid gently on his shoulder made Akbar look up. By his side
stood Faizi, to whom was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href=
"#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>allowed the privilege of
approaching the Emperor unannounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Akbar,&rdquo; said Faizi, &ldquo;awaken from your sad and
useless musing. Must I be the one to say to you, be a man!&mdash;I,
who, in comparison with you, am so weak? But it is necessary that I
should so speak. I do not feel less keenly the loss of my dear brother,
than you the loss of a true councillor and a much-loved friend. It is
necessary that we should both rouse ourselves, and not allow grief so
to overwhelm us as to make us weak in the face of dangers that still
threaten the kingdom; therefore I dare to say to you, show yourself
again a man. To be so cast down is unworthy of you; and if Ab&uacute;-l
Fazl could know it, he might perchance acknowledge for the first time
in his life that Akbar is not faultless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My true and noble friend,&rdquo; said Akbar, &ldquo;I thank
you from my heart for your frank words. To exchange thought for action
is indeed now necessary. However, you perhaps are mistaken as to the
nature of the thoughts in which you found me sunk; the memory of your
brother had only a share in them.&rdquo; And then Akbar recounted the
farewells of Aquaviva and Abdul Kadir, and the reflections to which
they had given rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all that,&rdquo; said Faizi, after a moment&rsquo;s
reflection, &ldquo;I recognise my magnanimous Emperor, and my
philosophical and idealistic friend. You <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>know what are my
feelings on the subject you have touched upon. I do not set much store
by what men are wont to call religious worship, when by that they mean
an unlimited mystical feeling devoid of all reality, and still less
when it depends on unproved propositions and dogmas that take their
rise in imagination. However right men may be when they call me
atheist, they are not so when they deem me an unbeliever. On the
contrary, I believe much; but my faith rests on firm ground, on that of
experience itself. Among other things, I believe, as I have said more
than once, in the law of gradual development, not in material life
alone, but especially in the soul and mind of man. In this development
I see the solution of the great problem that you, like all other
reformers and founders of religions, most wish to discover. Think where
we men began, and how far we have already progressed, and think at what
point we may yet arrive! We were nothing better than animals, and after
the lapse of some thousand years we are reasonable beings; and when
thousands and thousands of years have rolled by, where shall we be?
Shall we not&mdash;not only some of us, but all, perchance&mdash;have
attained a clear insight into the immortal and necessary union of
things (or union of spirit and matter) through continued search and
through the development of knowledge. Then, content <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>and
resting on this knowledge, should we not dispense with the dreams that
we now accept under the well-sounding name of religious worship, which,
well-considered, is only a means to satisfy our self-love, by assuring
us of salvation in a future state, which no mortal can put on one
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your spirit soars high,&rdquo; said Akbar, &ldquo;and your
eye sees far&mdash;to me it seems too far and too high. I think of the
present; the future brings me but little consolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Faizi, &ldquo;do I lose sight of the
present? Does it not belong to the first maxim of my faith&mdash;or, if
you prefer it, to my philosophy&mdash;that men should fulfil to the
uttermost the duties laid upon them? Truly, contemplation and knowledge
are idle when for their sake reality is thrust on one side. If
philosophy did not teach us to devote our powers to the living present,
then were it nothing but a phantasy and an idle delusion of the soul.
To work with zeal and energy for the end we propose to ourselves, is a
very different thing from wishing for impossibilities, and falling back
discouraged at our want of success. And so it is with religion, or, in
a more limited sense, with the religion of the people, or the
conviction of the people respecting the invisible world. This does not
develop suddenly at a sign from some inspired reformer, but slowly in
the course <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>of ages; and in all cases it must be preceded by
an indispensable condition, that of the cultivation and enlightenment
of the people, and this is not possible unless they possess the
means&mdash;not possible without prosperity. And in that which concerns
the first foundation of enlightenment and cultivation, has Akbar just
cause for self-reproach and discouragement? Can he say that he has not
done enough, or at least much, for the welfare of the people entrusted
to his rule? Look back, my Emperor, on what you have accomplished, and,
leaving your theological contemplations on one side, judge if the
consequences of what you have done are not the best encouragement to
continue with energy the work that is already begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faizi was right, it was no flattering speech of a courtier, when he
praised the social reforms that the Emperor had introduced and
continued with success. The experience of following centuries bear out
his words. Of Akbar&rsquo;s religious dreams scarcely a trace was left
after his death, but his land system has remained the foundation on
which the successive rulers of Hindustan have built, and at one time it
was proposed, by an able and intelligent Englishman, to introduce this
system into our Dutch Indian possessions, where it would have borne
good fruit. This, however, fell to the ground through the dulness and
want of knowledge of our Governors.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Faizi,&rdquo; said the Emperor, rising to his
feet and lifting up his head as though animated with new life;
&ldquo;we must work, not dream, work as long as the day remains,
unwearied, and without pausing. You must stand by me now that I have
lost my greatest support; and I think I may promise that you will be as
content with Akbar as he with you. But now for one more emblem; averse
to them as you are, this will find grace in your eyes. See yonder
faltering, mighty apparition! in that I recognise the condition in
which for days my soul has been bowed. But to-morrow the sun again
rises, and I will once more show myself, not as I am, but as I should
be. That is the duty of a prince. So long as the impulse does not come
from the people, the prince, with his councillors, should be the
fountain of light and life in the State. If at times I forget
this,&mdash;then, Faizi, call, as Ab&uacute;-l Fazl did, the holy duty
of a prince before my spirit, and speak to me as you have done this
night.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Emperor, at the head of his troops, had set out
for the north, and all accounts reported that he was already at some
distance from Agra. Siddha was still waiting for orders to join his
detachment, which had marched among the first; what wonder, then, if he
had sought to shorten the time of waiting by repeated visits to Rezia
Gulbadan! One evening he turned his steps towards her dwelling,
although he could not flatter himself it was with the same eagerness as
formerly. He had begun more and more to distrust her; and these
repeated visits were partly to obtain more knowledge of her secrets and
of the conspiracy. He little suspected that that evening would disclose
to him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>more than he cared to know. Arriving at the
little gate in the wall, he found, to his astonishment, that it was not
shut as usual, and, in all probability through carelessness, the key
had been left in the lock. He could therefore enter without giving the
usual signal. Carefully closing the door behind him, he ascended the
path with rapid steps. As he drew near the verandah he found fresh
reason for surprise. Just at that moment a man entered, whom, at first,
he did not recognise, but, as he withdrew into the thick shadow of the
many plants, the lamplight showed his uncle Salhana, who, scarcely
greeting Gulbadan, cried in the utmost excitement, &ldquo;We are
betrayed, shamefully betrayed! The Emperor,&rdquo; he continued, as
Gulbadan listened in terror, &ldquo;is acquainted with all our plans.
How, I know not, but it is too true. I have positive information from
Gorakh, who, as you know, accompanies the army in disguise. Akbar not
only knows of our undertaking from the beginning, but his spies have
informed him of all the changes that have taken place in our plans.
Cunning as he is, he let it come to our ears that he had seen through
our first plan, without letting us know that he was also acquainted
with the second; allowing us to think that he had fallen into the trap.
Now he and his army have marched as though really for Kashmir. That is
all very well, but he will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>suddenly turn round, and by forced
marches surprise us here at Agra, when we believe ourselves to be in
safety. I am only just warned in time to prevent Salim, on the settled
day, from being proclaimed Emperor; but that will not avail us much.
When Akbar knows all, he will not spare us, although he may not catch
Salim in the act; and nothing now remains for us but to have recourse
to the most extreme measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are they?&rdquo; asked Gulbadan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorakh and his followers,&rdquo; answered Salhana, &ldquo;can
aid us, and they must. Before the Emperor has time to reach Agra his
life must be taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words a shudder ran through Siddha, and he laid his hand on
the hilt of his dagger, and was about to step forward, but restrained
himself in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salim must know nothing of this,&rdquo; continued Salhana;
&ldquo;nor must we tell him when the deed is accomplished. He may,
indeed, have his suspicions, but he will conduct himself as though he
knew nothing; nor will he hold us in less honour. To-morrow I go to the
army to arrange all with Gorakh, who has told me how I may recognise
him in his disguise; and in the meantime you must take care that Salim
is warned. I myself will not visit him, for fear of rousing suspicions.
Tell me, on what footing are you now with him?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not seen him here for a long time,&rdquo; answered
Gulbadan; &ldquo;and the reasons for his continued absence are unknown
to me. However, I am not uneasy: I know, cost what it may, he will have
me for his Sultana; and that shall be when he is Emperor, not
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while waiting, you occupy your time with that nephew of
mine I entrusted to your care, is it not so? A brave young man, and one
in whom you seem to find pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a time; but now he begins rather to weary me; and, well
considered, he is not of much use. Without ceasing, one has to discuss
with him over and over again all kinds of ideas of honour and duty.
When he has served our turn, I shall show him the door, and all the
more, as he may stand in the way of my plans with Salim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; suddenly asked Salhana, turning towards
the garden side of the verandah: &ldquo;I think I hear a movement; is
it possible that some uninvited guest may have found his way
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; answered Gulbadan; &ldquo;the door in the
garden wall is locked, is it not?&rdquo;&mdash;Salhana had forgotten
that in his haste he had left it open.&mdash;&rdquo; And from the other
side there is no danger, for Faizi started this morning to join the
army. Go by this path, it will be more prudent, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>as
you might meet Siddha in the neighbourhood of the garden
wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All, then, is settled, is it not?&rdquo; said Salhana.
&ldquo;You undertake Salim and those here in Agra, and I charge myself
with Akbar; and if I am fortunate, we and his people will shortly be
freed from his rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a slight greeting Salhana then disappeared behind a curtain,
taking a side path unknown to Siddha, so that to follow him, according
to his first impulse, was impossible.</p>
<p>The best course now was to return at once, and ensure the failure of
the plot by warning the Emperor before the conspirators suspected
anything. But his longing to show Gulbadan that he had ceased to be her
despised tool was too great to be resisted, and with one bound he was
in the verandah and standing before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cursed snake!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you caused me to become
a traitor; but do not flatter yourself that your accursed plot and that
of yonder ruffian will succeed. I, who begin to weary you, will hinder
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you have been listening, then,&rdquo; said Gulbadan, an
expression of hate and malice crossing her hitherto gentle face,
depriving it of all its beauty; &ldquo;and now you intend to betray
us,&mdash;but that shall never be.&rdquo; Before Siddha could guess her
intention, she flew towards him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>aiming a blow at his heart
with a dagger. He half-mechanically sought to ward off the blow, but
his arm fell helpless to his side at the sight of a figure that
appeared to rise from the ground behind Gulbadan, and who seized the
murderess&rsquo; hand in an iron grasp.</p>
<p>Gulbadan turned round hastily, and sank with a cry of horror to the
earth. Behind her stood Faizi, and behind him two servants with drawn
swords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; she implored, returning to her senses, while
Siddha stood motionless, gazing at the scene before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, my lord and master!&rdquo; And with her head bowed
down so that her dark locks swept the ground, she crept on her knees
towards Faizi, who stepped back as she strove to approach him more
closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;do not touch me. Bind that
woman,&rdquo; he said, turning to his followers, &ldquo;and take her to
my castle of Mathura. There let her be closely watched; and should she
ever make an attempt, however slight, to enter into communication with
the outer world, then carry out the sentence from which to-day I spare
her. Never again will I see her, nor a single hair of her guilty
head.&rdquo; Then he turned and spoke to the fallen one who knelt at
his feet; but his words were not such as to lighten her punishment.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>&ldquo;Hope gives life,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;and you, whose name will never more pass my lips, perhaps
flatter yourself with a vain expectation. You think you can reckon on
the protection of one more powerful than I, or who will one day be so.
You think that Salim will stand by you, and release you from your
imprisonment. This is a vain hope. He whom you have also deceived
imparted to me your connection with yonder man; and this was Salim
himself, whom you imagined safe in your toils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Gulbadan had raised her head, and listened with
attention; but at his last words, with a cry she sank senseless to the
ground, her arms stretched out in front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your duty,&rdquo; said Faizi to his followers. And she was
hastily conveyed from the apartment. &ldquo;And now you,&rdquo; said
he, approaching Siddha, as he drew his sword from the scabbard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have forfeited my life,&rdquo; replied Siddha.
&ldquo;Strike! I ask nothing better than death from your
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I understand,&rdquo; said Faizi, thoughtfully, and
letting the sword sink slowly back into its sheath; &ldquo;and I am not
inclined to fulfil your wishes. Others in the same case would think
differently. A Musalman would lay your head before his feet; a Hindu
would have you strangled; and a Frank, most foolish of all,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>would challenge you to fight. But I choose none
of these. You may live, and depart unharmed from hence. Live, with the
remembrance of the ill you have done, and of the manner in which you,
who call yourself a nobleman, have repaid a true friendship. The
remembrance of this shall never leave you, though you may become famous
and rise high in rank; and however highly you may be honoured and
respected, yet you will always cast down your eyes before any
honourable man, remembering how in your youth you treated a friend.
This is the punishment I lay upon you! Now go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obeying an imperious sign from Faizi, and bowed down with shame,
Siddha turned, and with faltering step took his way through the garden
and still open door. For a time he wandered on unconscious of all
around him. In spite of the lateness of the hour, he saw some labourers
busy lading a boat; and as though it were his own affair, he stood
narrowly watching their every movement, now wondering how they would
manage to convey in safety some heavy bale over the plank that
connected the vessel with the shore, and now shaking his head at their
awkwardness. Then some soldiers attracted his attention, who sat
drinking and playing dice by the wavering light of a torch, and he
began to wish to join them in drinking and playing. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>But
at that moment one thought drove out all others<span class="corr" id=
"xd20e3980" title="Not in source">,</span> the remembrance of the plot
to murder the Emperor. Had Faizi heard all, so that he could warn
Akbar? But these questions he was unable to answer. Then why not go
himself, without a moment&rsquo;s further waste of time? Salhana was to
start the following morning, and another starting at once could easily
precede him.</p>
<p>Siddha wasted no more time in thought, but hurried to the quarter of
the city where his detachment was; and giving over the command to
another officer, he turned to his own dwelling, and ordered Vatsa to
saddle the bay&mdash;the bay given him by Faizi, and which, after
discovering Rezia&rsquo;s true name, he had never dared either to ride
or return, though now, in the service of the Emperor and empire, he
mounted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prepare to follow me to the army,&rdquo; he said to Vatsa, as
he led the horse out, &ldquo;but at some distance. Start in an
hour&rsquo;s time, ride hard, and if necessary deliver the message with
which I entrust you.&rdquo; He then imparted to him as much as was
necessary touching the plot against the Emperor, and ordered him to
seek Akbar at once if he should not find his master with the army.
Having said this, he struck spurs to his horse, and set off at a
gallop.</p>
<p>A hurried journey, neither allowing himself nor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>his
horse necessary repose, soon brought him to the army; and no sooner had
he reached the camp than he sought an audience with the Emperor, which,
after a short delay, was granted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do here?&rdquo; asked Akbar, in a stern voice.
&ldquo;Who has given you leave to desert your post in Agra? It may go
hardly with you if you cannot answer to my satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Siddha, &ldquo;if I had nothing worse
than this to answer for, I might call myself happy; but I come to
accuse myself of the greatest crime a soldier can be guilty of against
his prince&mdash;that of treason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected as much,&rdquo; said the Emperor, &ldquo;and
therefore gave you orders not to leave your post; and now you yourself
come to assure me of your treachery. Good; speak further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As shortly as possible, without withholding anything, Siddha
recounted how, led away by Gulbadan, he had deceived his friend and
benefactor, and become a traitor to his Emperor. During this recital
Akbar paced up and down with slow steps, his countenance expressing
nothing of what his feelings might be; but as Siddha ceased, he stopped
before him, and said, sternly, &ldquo;Your crimes deserve
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I know well,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>I come to receive my punishment at the hands of
your Majesty,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not seek safety in flight, when you suspected
that your treason was discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crimes demand their penalty; and how can I go forth into the
world while it remains unpaid, an object of contempt to myself and
others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how is it that you have come so suddenly to this
determination? For this there must be some cause. I suspect you have
not told me all; something is still wanting to your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right; but what I have still to tell could not be
said until my doom was pronounced. Now I can proceed. The power which,
in spite of myself, that woman so long had over me was suddenly broken.
The bandage fell from my eyes, and at last I saw clearly what I was, of
what I had been guilty, and what punishment I deserved.&rdquo; And now
followed more in detail the description of the scene that had taken
place on the last evening he had seen Gulbadan, and of the plot he had
overheard.</p>
<p>Still no expression was visible on the Emperor&rsquo;s countenance;
but, as he again walked up and down, his step was more hurried. When
the story was ended he remained for some time silent, and then said,
&ldquo;With reason you seem to have thought that your last
communication might <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297"
name="pb297">297</a>]</span>have some influence over the sentence that
I had to pronounce on you. You have rendered a great service to me and
to my kingdom, and you are mistaken if you imagine that the sentence I
pronounced was an irrevocable one. To say that a crime deserves death,
is not to say that no mercy can be shown to him who is guilty of it;
and yours is a case in point. Without your further communication, I
might have recalled what I said, and shown you mercy. You have sinned
deeply, Siddha, against me, and certainly not less against my friend.
You are not a criminal, you have been the victim of an overwhelming
temptation, and I know myself what it is to be so tried. But your
feeling of honour was not destroyed, and sprang again into life as soon
as you awoke from your dream. I do not in the least palliate what you
have done, nor consider your fault a light one; but I am of opinion
that you do not belong to the class incapable of improvement, and who,
for the sake of society, cannot be allowed to live. I believe that your
future actions will wipe away the memory of your misdeeds, and your
conduct of to-day assures me that you will never again be guilty of
treachery towards me. I therefore give you your life, and leave you in
possession of your rank. Do not let me be deceived in you a second
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments Siddha found it impossible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>to
reply, but knelt before the Emperor and kissed respectfully the hem of
his robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Sire,&rdquo; he said at last, as the Emperor
signed to him to rise, &ldquo;not for life, that was no longer of any
value in my eyes, but for the opportunity granted me in some measure to
make up for the ill I have done. And if I may ask another favour, it is
that I may at once be allowed to take part in the war that is now being
waged in the north against the robber bands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This favour I will also grant,&rdquo; said the Emperor;
&ldquo;but first I will entrust you with another task. Some of the most
faithful of my own life-guards shall be placed under your orders; go
with them to meet Salhana, seize him, and bring him here in the
greatest secresy, so that Gorakh may know nothing of his
arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a sign from the Emperor the audience was at an end; and no sooner
had Siddha received the command of his troop of guards than he was
again on the road. Sooner than he had expected, he met his uncle, who
appeared to have travelled in great haste, and was accompanied by two
followers. These were soon disarmed and prisoners. Salhana defended
himself for some time, but was at last overpowered, and, to his anger,
pinioned by order of his nephew, whom until that moment he had held in
such contempt. A veil was flung <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299"
href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>around his head, so that no
passers-by might recognise him, and he was hurried by his captors to
the camp.</p>
<p>In the Emperor&rsquo;s tent his bonds were loosened, and he was left
alone with Akbar and Siddha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your treachery, Salhana,&rdquo; said the Emperor, &ldquo;and
your latest plans are known to me; your nephew has told me all. Prepare
to die,&mdash;the executioners await you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flinging a glance of rage and hatred towards Siddha, Salhana threw
himself at Akbar&rsquo;s feet, touching the ground with his forehead.
&ldquo;Spare my life,&rdquo; he implored. &ldquo;Punish me, gracious
Prince, as you will; but let me live, and I will confess all, and tell
all that I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salhana,&rdquo; replied the Emperor, contemptuously, &ldquo;I
knew that you were a traitor and a villain; but I had still to learn
that you were also a coward. As for your confessions, they are
worthless; I already know all that you can tell me excepting one thing,
where and how is Gorakh to be found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I can tell you,&rdquo; cried Salhana, welcoming with joy
this ray of hope; &ldquo;I can tell you exactly how to find him, and
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will grant you a shameful life; but should your information
prove false, then, you understand, the sword awaits you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salhana now eagerly gave all particulars by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>which Gorakh might be recognised in his
disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have this man closely watched,&rdquo; commanded the Emperor,
turning to Siddha; &ldquo;and you yourself, with your men, go in search
of Gorakh, and when you have found him, hang him on the nearest
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This order was executed without delay. They were soon on the track
of the Durga priest, and before long he was their prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! my young friend,&rdquo; said he, with his hateful laugh,
recognising Siddha; &ldquo;and is this the way you repay the interest
that I have shown in you? However, let it be; but show me one courtesy,
that can cost you nothing. Tell me, who is my betrayer? It can only be
Salhana; am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; answered Siddha; and then, turning to his
followers, he said, &ldquo;Forward! take this man outside the camp, and
carry out the sentence pronounced by the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the sentence?&rdquo; asked Gorakh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The halter,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that is in my line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was needless to bind him, for, without the slightest attempt at
escape, he calmly walked between two soldiers.</p>
<p>For some time Siddha did not turn to look at him, nor did his guards
observe his actions very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>closely. But as they left the
camp, and Siddha turned to give some orders to his followers, he saw
the Yogi busied in marking characters on a long leaf that he held in
his left hand, and must either have picked up on the road, or have had
concealed in his clothes. In another moment he held it high in the air,
waving it as though it were a fan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried Siddha, impatiently, &ldquo;leave that
juggling alone, it can help you no further, and throw that leaf away;
we have had enough of your magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gorakh obeyed, but not before he had laughingly made two more signs
in the air. He then threw it on the ground, and they proceeded on their
way. A few moments later the lifeless body of the priest hung from the
bough of a tree.</p>
<p>In the meantime two men, from their appearance the servants of some
nobleman, had witnessed the arrest, and, unnoticed, had followed at
some little distance the troop that was conducting the doomed man to
his place of punishment. As soon as the soldiers had passed the place
where Gorakh had flung away the leaf, the two men sought eagerly in the
sand, and soon found the object of their search. It was a dry leaf, on
which were hastily written a few words with some sharp-pointed
instrument. After reading <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href=
"#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>it together, one concealed it
carefully in his garment, and they hurried back to the camp.</p>
<p>There, as soon as the news of Gorakh&rsquo;s death reached the
Emperor, Salhana received the promise of his life; but was given in
charge to some soldiers, who were to guard him closely. When the war
was ended, then should it be decided what was to be done with him.
Imprisonment in some fortress or other, he understood well, would be
his lot so long as Akbar reigned. But when Salim ascended the throne,
without doubt he would be set free; and then, perhaps, too, he would
have an opportunity of wreaking his vengeance on Siddha.</p>
<p>He was not so closely watched but that it was possible to approach
him; and one evening it happened that the servant of a splendidly
dressed person that passed by, slipt a rolled-up leaf into his hand.
What could it be? A secret communication from one of his friends, from
Gulbadan perhaps, pointing out some means of flight.
&ldquo;Salhana,&rdquo; ran the hastily written note, &ldquo;the Emperor
who has doomed me shall not die to serve you; Durga chooses for her
victim you, who have betrayed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cry of terror, Salhana&rsquo;s arms fell helpless to his
side, and the leaf dropped to the ground. He knew but too well the
meaning of those few words, and he knew that his sentence was
irrevocable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>The last order of the Durga priest would not be
neglected; rather hundreds of his followers would be sacrificed than
leave that command unfulfilled. Was there indeed no hope, no chance for
him? In truth, as good as none. If he were but in Agra or in some
fortress! where it might not be so easy to penetrate to him as here in
the open field. But he was in the rear of the army, which only
progressed slowly. He implored his guards to keep good watch by him, as
his life was threatened by assassins; but they only laughed at him, and
he heard them say to each other, &ldquo;That would be no great
loss.&rdquo; Then he prayed to be allowed to have a light at night, and
this request was only met with ridicule at his cowardice. He had not
another peaceful moment. During the march he imagined that behind every
bush he saw some dark figure lurking, that watched and followed in his
footsteps. When they halted to rest he remained on his guard, keeping
his eyes on the jungle and trees around. And then the night&mdash;the
long, frightful, endless night! He did his best to remain awake,
listening to every sound, and feeling around him in the dark; but at
times sleep overcame him, and he awoke with a start of terror, and felt
his throat, thinking he could not breathe. Sometimes he fancied the
cord was round his neck, and about to be drawn tight; then he had to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>convince himself, by feeling with his fingers,
that it was only imagination; and at last to put his hand to his throat
became quite an involuntary movement. Then the question rose before
him, whether he should not take his own life, and so end his martyrdom;
but he dared not, his courage was not sufficient to plunge a dagger
into his own heart; and then there was still the hope, however slight,
that he might arrive safely at Agra. But slowly and still more slowly
marched the army. At last the Thugs took upon themselves the task
Salhana dared not perform, and freed him from his suffering. Early one
morning his guard found him lying dead in the tent that had been
pitched for his shelter during the night. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the meantime affairs at Agra followed the course
which Akbar and his councillors had foreseen, especially after having
received Siddha&rsquo;s communication. It had been feared that Salim
might be warned in time of the return of the army, and would not be
caught in the act, in which case great difficulty would have arisen in
convicting the Prince of treason; but now that the message from Gorakh,
the chief of the conspirators in the army, had been intercepted; and
that Gulbadan had been deprived of the means of warning Salim, the
chance had greatly improved. In truth, though reports did reach the
ears of the conspirators of the return of the Emperor and his army, yet
as they were not confirmed by any tidings from their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>accomplices, these reports were considered as an
attempt on the part of Akbar&rsquo;s friends to prevent the conspiracy
from being carried out.</p>
<p>On the appointed day, Salim took possession of the imperial palace,
and caused himself to be openly proclaimed Emperor. At the same time he
dismissed many of the principal officers, appointing others in their
places. Alarm and surprise became general throughout the town. Rich
people closed their houses, and tradesmen their shops, and Agra, so
populous and full of life, appeared a city of the dead. The reports of
Akbar&rsquo;s return had found more belief among the people than among
the conspirators, and they feared a terrible struggle when Salim,
having strengthened himself in the fortress, should be able to offer a
formidable opposition to his father. But when the Prince demanded
admission to the fortress, to his no small astonishment the governor
refused compliance, shut the gate, and directed his artillery on the
town. The governor, faithful to Akbar, had, with his knowledge, chosen
the side of Salim, so that the latter had thought himself certain of
the fort. And now the reports of the movement of the army gained
strength, and it was said that it was within an easy day&rsquo;s march.
Placed, as it were, between two fires, and finding himself deserted by
others who had aided his rebellion, Salim <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>saw that his only
hope was instant flight. But it was too late; the advanced troops had
already closed all the entrances to the town, and as Salim attempted
with a few followers to leave it, he was taken prisoner by a division
of cavalry, and, though treated with respect, carried back to the
palace where he had been proclaimed Emperor. A few days later he
received an invitation to appear before Akbar, who had then returned to
Agra&mdash;his prince, his father, and his judge! Salim was brave,
still he felt his courage sink, being fully conscious of his guilt. He
knew that Akbar could be generous, but still that he could be severe in
inflicting punishment when it was necessary for the welfare of his
kingdom. His well-grounded fear gave way to surprise, when, left alone
with the Emperor, he found him stretched on a divan, supporting his
head on his hand, the other hand hanging wearily over the side. He did
not alter his position as the guilty one entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have long delayed seeing you, Salim,&rdquo; began Akbar at
last, throwing a hasty glance at his son, who stood covered with shame
before him. &ldquo;I dreaded this interview, and wished that it might
be spared me.&rdquo; For a few moments he was silent, then half raising
himself, and holding his arm up in the air, he burst into a passionate
and bitter complaint. &ldquo;My son, my son,&rdquo; he cried,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>&ldquo;that I should have lived to see this! To
what have false friends and a false ambition led you? You knew how dear
you were to me, and how, when it was possible, I sought to forestall
your slightest wishes, and how I loaded you with honours and treasure;
you know, too, you have heard more than once, both from your mother and
myself, how I, then childless, prayed for the gift of a son, and how,
when the prayer was granted, I celebrated it by the foundation of
Fathp&uacute;r, where I had so often offered my prayers to Allah. But
had I known what awaited me at your hands, my prayers had not been so
earnest, nor my joy so great when they were granted. Ah! was it
impossible that for once you should place some restraint on yourself,
and wait with patience for your father&rsquo;s death before you
ascended your throne? was it impossible to return in the slightest
degree the love that I had always cherished for you, and which had
surrounded you with benefits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salim knew not how to reply, as his father for a moment ceased to
speak. He felt this reception deeply, so different from what he had
expected, and the loving though melancholy words addressed to him, in
spite of his errors; for Salim was not bad, nor hard-hearted, but weak
and easily led; and on him rested the curse of despotism that Akbar had
escaped,&mdash;the curse of the despot, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>of
him who is to become one,&mdash;that of placing his own will in the way
of right and duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no,&rdquo; continued the Emperor, &ldquo;you would not,
or rather you could not. You have never possessed the power of
restraining yourself in anything; how, then, should you in this? For a
time I saw with joy that you had given up your drinking, but for how
short a time did this improvement last! You, who in my place wish to
rule over others, cannot rule yourself. Had you only better understood
your position, then your own interest would have shown you the right
path. You would have seen that the straightforward fulfilment of duty
would gain the respect and love of your future subjects; while actions
such as those you were guilty of, only rendered you contemptible in
their eyes, and when you had gained your wish and were their ruler,
their obedience would be due to fear or self-interest, so foolishly and
blameably have you lost their respect, and covered yourself and me with
shame. If I could but have prevented this! I attempted it, when,
following the counsel of Faizi, who was always well inclined towards
you, I sent you to Allahabad, not suspecting that Salhana was a false
traitor and one of the most dangerous of the party that was seeking to
mislead you. Enough; the attempt to save you from your evil companions
failed, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>things continued their course. Then it became
necessary to prove publicly that neither craft nor force could avail
against Akbar, and that the reins of government remained in the
Emperor&rsquo;s hands. You have forced me to it, and on your head rests
the blame of what has happened to-day. You have done yourself much
injury, and grieved me deeply, more deeply than you can comprehend. May
you never learn from experience what a father feels when, sword in
hand, he is forced to meet his son as an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sad experience was not spared Salim, and in his old age the day
came when the words of his father returned to his mind, and when Shah
Jahan, his dearly-loved son, not only opposed him in the field, but
defeated him more than once. When his father ceased speaking, his
conscience awoke from its long sleep, and he recognised that crime to
its fullest extent, which false councillors had palliated and made
light of. Overcome by his feelings he flung himself on his knees before
his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise up,&rdquo; said the Emperor, at last, after having for
some time silently regarded his son; &ldquo;and listen. That I possess
full right to inflict punishment upon you, you less than anyone can
dispute. But I require from you no further humiliation than that which
you have already undergone. I do not wish it, because it would damage
your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>future rule, shaking that respect which men will
owe to you when you succeed me on the throne. If I punished you further
publicly, I might as well declare you disinherited, and choose one of
your brothers as my successor; but that I neither will nor can do. I
hold you too dear to take such a course, so long as it can be avoided;
nevertheless all depends on you. Tell me frankly, do you wish to work
with me for the good of my kingdom, or do you feel no inclination and
no strength for it? In the one case I will charge you with an
honourable, though it may be laborious share; in the other, you can
remain at my court, and there endeavour to learn as much of the art of
government as is indispensable for your future. I leave the choice to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; replied Salim, &ldquo;I feel that I deserve
neither of the generous offers you make me, and I should not complain
if my last deed excluded me from the succession to the throne; but if
indeed you leave me the choice, then, without hesitation, I choose the
first. However difficult and dangerous may be the task entrusted to me,
I will strive my utmost to fulfil it. You have indeed laden me with
favours and honours, perhaps too many; my time has been thrown away in
idleness, while you spent every day, from morning to evening, labouring
for the good of the State; and then miserable idleness led me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>away to listen to the temptation of traitors,
who pictured to me the fame that would be mine when power was once in
my hands. Now, give me some work, however lowly, and I may perhaps be
able to make up for the evil I have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You judge yourself justly,&rdquo; said Akbar, &ldquo;and to
know oneself is the first step in the right path. I acknowledge that I
am not myself free from blame for leaving you without employment, in
the midst of luxury and self-indulgence. But enough of this. The rich
and fruitful Bengal has not long been subject to my rule, and does not
yet enjoy the privileges of a settled government. Go, and help me to
carry out my principles of government there also. You shall reign under
me, but almost as an independent king, until the day when, after having
won the respect and love of your people, you shall in peace succeed to
the empire of the whole of Hindustan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears of joy and gratitude sprang to Salim&rsquo;s eyes, as he
respectfully kissed the Emperor&rsquo;s hand before leaving him, full
of fresh courage and a new love of life. The reconciliation between
father and son was sincere, and Akbar foresaw that the peace and
friendship between them would never again be disturbed.</p>
<p>Though joy reigned in Agra as the time passed by, in Allahabad there
was sorrow, at least in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href=
"#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>Iravati&rsquo;s heart; for the new
governor, in a few words, had imparted to her the news of her
father&rsquo;s death, but withheld from her all particulars, while he
begged that she would remain in the castle as long as she pleased. She
had never been aware of the crime of which Salhana had been guilty; and
though she had not loved her father very dearly, still she had always
held him in the highest respect, and, forgetting his recent treatment,
she mourned him truly. In the midst of her grief another event
happened, which gave her a fresh shock. Not long after the tidings of
Salhana&rsquo;a death had reached her, Kulluka the Brahman was
announced. His faithful servant had been his only companion on his
perilous journey from the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble lady,&rdquo; he said, when admitted to Iravati&rsquo;s
presence, &ldquo;I accepted a sad task when I undertook to deliver a
message, sad both for you and me. I bring you a token that you know
well&rdquo;: and feeling in his girdle, he drew out a finely-woven
veil, and laid it in her hands. It was the same she had thrown to
Siddha when for the last time she had seen him beneath her balcony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand all,&rdquo; she cried, turning deadly white;
&ldquo;he is no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I left him,&rdquo; answered Kulluka, &ldquo;he was still
alive, but I fear the worst, and I doubt <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>whether I shall ever
more see my former pupil in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say, what has happened?&rdquo; asked Iravati. &ldquo;See,
I am quite composed, and can listen calmly to all you have to
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Kulluka recounted all that he knew of Siddha&rsquo;s last
encounter. The Emperor had granted his earnest wish, and allowed him to
march with his Rajp&uacute;ts against the rebels in the north. There
for some time, among the mountains so well known to him, he carried on
a war which was both successful and glorious; he sought rather than
avoided dangers, and had been victor in many a daring adventure, from
which even the bravest of his followers had shrunk. At last, however,
the insurgent bands, as he was traversing a mountain pass, managed to
cut him off from the main body of his troop. After a long and hard
struggle, in which many of the enemy fell before his sword, covered
with wounds, he sank from his horse to the earth, while most of his
followers lay either wounded or dead around him. Vatsa, who had never
left his side, instead of attempting useless revenge, let himself slip
from his horse, and lay motionless as though dead. A few moments later
the troop arrived and drove back the enemy, and Vatsa sprang to his
feet and found to his joy that his master still lived. With the help of
some of the soldiers the wounded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315"
href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>man was laid on a rude,
hastily constructed litter, and carried to a Buddhist cloister in the
neighbourhood. &ldquo;At that moment,&rdquo; continued Kulluka,
&ldquo;I was myself in the cloister, when the soldiers arrived with
their sorely wounded leader. The good monks gladly afforded him all the
help in their power. Among them was one learned in medicine, who
assured me that neither skill nor care should be spared to bring him
back to life. After a time Siddha regained consciousness, and seeing
me, made a sign of recognition; but it was some minutes before he
gained strength to speak. &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am
going to leave you, I feel that I cannot recover. Do me a
service.&rsquo; I looked inquiringly to the monk learned in healing,
but he shook his head. He also seemed to have little or no hope. He
strove to enjoin silence on Siddha, but Siddha heeded not. &lsquo;I
must speak,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;Kulluka, take the veil that you will
find there with my armour, take it as quickly as possible to Iravati,
and tell her that she was never so dear to me as now that death is
near. Go at once, and do not wait for my death; let me die knowing that
she has received this token from your hands.&rsquo; He then shut his
eyes and spoke no more. I did not hesitate to fulfil his last wish; and
taking the veil, and leaving Siddha to the faithful care of the monks
and Vatsa, I at once set out.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Iravati, &ldquo;for the service you
have rendered us both. But Siddha still lived, he was not dead when you
left him? Then I know what I have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do?&rdquo; asked the Brahman. &ldquo;What can you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go with you to Siddha,&rdquo; answered Iravati
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Kulluka in astonishment; &ldquo;a weak,
helpless woman attempt to pass through mountains and forests swarming
with bands of insurgents and robbers, without a strong
escort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not fear,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;to expose
yourself to these dangers to fulfil Siddha&rsquo;s wishes, and I fear
them as little. Do not be afraid that you will find me a hindrance; I
am not so weak, and am well accustomed to mountains and forests.
No,&rdquo; continued Iravati, as Kulluka made fresh objections,
&ldquo;do not attempt to shake my resolution, you will not succeed; and
if you will not take me, then I will travel, accompanied by a servant.
Do you think that I have come hastily to this determination, and that I
shall draw back? I have more than once thought of the possibility of
such an event as has now happened. I have often compared my life to
that of Damayanti, and have determined that she should be my example.
And what is my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>self-sacrifice to hers? Alone and despoiled of
everything, she wandered through the wilderness, seeking her faithless
consort. I, at least if you allow it, go under the protection of a man
of tried courage, and where he can force his way I can
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His arm will never fail when you need his protection,&rdquo;
cried Kulluka; &ldquo;and though his arm may be stiff, it still has
strength enough to wield a sword. I both honour and respect the
resolution to which you have come. Now prepare for the journey, and you
will find me ready to undertake it with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without delay Iravati gave orders to her servant to hasten all the
necessary preparations for the journey, while in a few words she told
her the reason for undertaking it. The faithful Nipunika was not a
little shocked when she heard the recital, but as she made an attempt
to dissuade her dearly loved mistress from the undertaking, Iravati
insisted on silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go with you,&rdquo; entreated she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Iravati, &ldquo;that is impossible; to
protect one woman is enough for Kulluka and his servant. I have told
you of my plan, which for the present must be a secret, in order that,
in case I should not return, some one may know where I am, and what I
am doing in Kashmir.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href=
"#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But would it not be better to ask the Governor for an
escort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for a few armed men would awaken suspicion; and the
Governor cannot spare a strong detachment. We three alone have a far
better chance of accomplishing our journey in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not, however, possible to depart at once, for Kulluka&rsquo;s
horses were so fatigued by the distance they had come, that rest was
necessary until the following day. Iravati found the hours of waiting
long and wearisome: she sat, still dreaming over the one subject that
was master of all her thoughts. Suddenly, with a terror which she could
not explain to herself, she looked up as she heard the step of some one
approaching, and in the next moment the man whom of all others she
least expected to see, stood before her&mdash;Salim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am on my way to Bengal,&rdquo; answered the Prince,
&ldquo;and have arrived at a fortunate moment, to hinder you from
carrying out a plan too wild and foolish ever to have found place in
the mind of a sensible woman. Through love to you your servant has
disobeyed your orders, and begged me to interfere, which I have
promised to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not trouble yourself, my lord, with my plans, I
entreat,&rdquo; said Iravati. &ldquo;I am no longer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>a
child that knows not what it does; and in any case, it is not your duty
to watch over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall do so, for the sake of your welfare, and
also&mdash;why should I not say it frankly?&mdash;because I cannot bear
to see you go to my hated rival, who is himself untrue to you. I cannot
bear the idea of your showering caresses on this man, if you find him
living, when you have rejected me; and therefore I shall make use of my
power, and force you to remain here against your will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do so, Salim,&rdquo; answered Iravati, &ldquo;but you
will not. You know well that instead of gaining by so cowardly an
exercise of your power you would only lose; you would not win me, nor
hasten Siddha&rsquo;s death by one moment; and this action would draw
down upon you my deepest contempt instead of the respect which, until
now, I have felt for you, although I could not give you my love. Do you
desire this? And not my contempt alone, but also your own. Will you
behave as a weak woman who is not master of her own heart, and give way
to unreasonable passion? or do you wish to behave as a man who knows
how to rule himself, and who, by so doing, shows me he is worthy to
reign over others? Choose for yourself; I ask no favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With hasty step Salim paced up and down, while within his breast
there was a bitter struggle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href=
"#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>between duty and passion, honour
and self-will. To allow her, whom he had vainly striven to win, to go
to his accursed rival was hard, almost beyond his powers. Still she was
right; the exercise of his might would avail him nothing, only cause
him to lose her respect, which he prized above everything. And then her
last words, recalling his noble, generous father&rsquo;s exhortation,
which he had so deeply felt! Self-control, self-denial, the first
duties and virtues indispensable to a prince&mdash;never before had he
considered them seriously; and after his promises to lead a new life,
should his first action be one which Iravati, with justice, called a
cowardly exercise of power?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iravati,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;I submit, as I did
before, to your will. What it costs me I need not say. Enough, I obey.
Alas! as I said before, why did I not know you earlier? You would have
made a different man of me; but this is all over, and I will endeavour
to submit to the inevitable. Go, then; though I cannot but consider
your resolution as rash, still I admit it to be courageous and noble.
One thing more. It is not impossible that you may still find Siddha
living, and then I understand only too well that you will be
reconciled, and keep the faith you have sworn to him. I shall look upon
this with envy, but neither seek vengeance on you nor on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>him
whom you hold dear. Let it be said that the weak and selfish Salim
controlled himself, and that the future ruler of Hindustan can rule his
own heart. If, sooner or later, you or Siddha Rama have need of my
protection, I give my princely word that it shall not fail you. Only
one favour I ask of you, though you will receive none from me. Although
it may be that we shall never meet again, do not refuse me your
friendship, and do not think with anger and contempt of a man whose
crimes towards you were caused by the deep love he felt for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He awaited no answer, but hurried away. &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; he
murmured, &ldquo;for once at least you have cause to be content with
your son.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322"

<h2 class="main">Faizi&rsquo;s Curse.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a Buddhist monastery among the mountains, Siddha
lay stretched on his sick bed, while Iravati watched by his side. Her
joy had been great at finding him still alive when, after her long and
dangerous journey, she at length arrived; but this joy had been
tempered by the doctor&rsquo;s assurance that his state was a most
critical one. When she was admitted to his room, she found him still
senseless; and who could say whether he would ever regain
consciousness, or recognise her before his death?</p>
<p>After a long time of anxious watching, a slight improvement gave
rise to hope, and Iravati was warned that if she would continue to tend
the wounded man, she must allow herself more rest. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>Kulluka and the monks persuaded her to take
short walks; and it was not without pleasure that she at times visited
the little temple belonging to the monastery when the bell called the
believers to prayer. With earnest attention she listened to the words
of the chief priest when he spoke of the gradations of human life, and
how sorrow fell on all, and how rare were the visits of happiness, and
how the greatest bliss for man was to be freed from all human ties and
to attain Nirv&aacute;na.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4207src" href=
"#xd20e4207" name="xd20e4207src">1</a> In these teachings Kulluka found
much with which he could not agree, and, in other circumstances, would
perhaps have remarked to the priest that to live for the good of others
was a nobler aim of life than to remain sunk in idle contemplation. But
opposition was perhaps superfluous. The practice of these Buddhists was
better than their teaching; for though they took no part in the
turbulent life and sorrows of the world, still they did not spend their
time in idleness. Unwearily they wandered amongst the mountains,
visiting all the poor inhabitants, scattering their good deeds and
consolation wherever misery was to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>found, without
respect of nationality, religion, or caste.</p>
<p>One evening Iravati was seated by Siddha&rsquo;s couch, while the
doctor watched him from the other side, when he slowly opened his eyes,
and, throwing a hasty glance around him, seemed to recognise Iravati.
He softly murmured her name, and again closed his eyes. The doctor made
a sign to Iravati to withdraw, which she unwillingly obeyed, and
hastened, with a heart full of joy, to seek Kulluka, and to impart to
him the glad news. The next day the improvement still continued, and
the patient could even speak. But Siddha made but little use of this
power even when Iravati was with him; and though he knew her and his
friend, he did not seem to remember any of the events that had
happened,&mdash;a mist seemed to hang over his mind. Almost without
consciousness he would sit, gazing before him, and only Iravati&rsquo;s
voice could arouse him from this stupefaction. This still continued,
even after his bodily strength returned and he was again able to take
exercise.</p>
<p>Once it happened, as he strolled with Iravati in the neighbourhood
of the monastery, that some word of hers, or some object on which his
eye fell&mdash;she herself could not tell which&mdash;seemed to awaken
memory in him. Suddenly he stood still, gazing with wonder around him,
and passed his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>hand over his face. Then shaking his head, he
walked on, and then again stood still, gazing inquiringly at the high
mountain tops, then at the blue sky, and at the valleys and woods that
lay around. A deadly pallor crept over his face, and with a wild look
he turned to Iravati. Memory had returned in its full strength, but
how? and, perchance, was not forgetfulness both better and happier?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go!&rdquo; he cried, at last. &ldquo;What are you doing
here, unhappy one, with me? How can you bear that I should approach
you&mdash;I, the faithless traitor, laden with the heaviest curse that
was ever laid on man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iravati listened in breathless terror. She did not understand all,
though more than enough. She attempted to speak, but her voice failed
her, and overcome with sorrow, she sank at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The curse!&rdquo; repeated Siddha, wildly; &ldquo;the curse
of Faizi&mdash;&rsquo;Live with the memory of what you have done; and
though you may attain all your heart desires, yet shall you always cast
down your eyes before an honourable man.&rsquo; And should I dare to
raise them to you, pure and innocent, whom I betrayed as basely as I
did my noble friend! Go, I say, far from here. A figure stands between
you and me. It is that of Faizi. He stands there, threatening as when
he spoke my doom.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href=
"#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span></p>
<p>As Iravati raised her head, she saw him cover his face with his
hands, as though he dared not look at her. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;let us go in; you have done too much, and so false visions
torment you. Come, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visions,&rdquo; answered Siddha, bitterly; &ldquo;would that
they were! But, no. I am now again myself; my strength has returned,
and with it the recollection, the terrible recollection, more real than
ever. I never yet felt the full meaning of Faizi&rsquo;s words; but now
that I again see you, I comprehend them. Before the Emperor, and even
before the meanest of my soldiers, have I cast down my eyes with shame;
but never as now. Vainly I sought an honourable death. Iravati,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;you do not know with whom you speak; you do not
know my last crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;though perhaps not
exactly what happened between Faizi and yourself; but I have gathered
sufficient from the words you have let fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you still speak to me,&rdquo; cried Siddha.
&ldquo;You do not turn from me; you even come to tend my last
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not give you my word, Siddha? and was I not bound to
keep it until you yourself gave it to me back? and that you have never
done. Did you not send me by Kulluka the token <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>that
told your last thought was mine? and I felt that I had taken duties on
me, although no marriage ties bound us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I now release you from your promise,&rdquo; said Siddha.
&ldquo;It is true that no sooner did I awaken from that miserable
blindness than my love for you returned with a strength that until then
I did not know. You, you can be true to me, and fulfil all your duties.
But you can love me no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you now, as I always did,&rdquo; replied Iravati.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seek to convince yourself that you do, from an
exaggerated feeling of honour; but it is not possible that you should
do so, and the day would come when you would regret that you had not
known yourself better. There can be no love where there is no respect.
The woman must look up to the man, and unhappy is the union where he is
the weaker. Go, and forget me; I am not even worthy of your
remembrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you thrust me away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no right to thrust you away, nor to release you from
your word. I only do so in order to give you rest, and to spare you any
self-reproach that you might feel at leaving me of your own free
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to my prayer, Siddha,&rdquo; said she, entreatingly,
and laying her hand on his arm. &ldquo;I will not dispute what you say,
I will not wish or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328"
name="pb328">328</a>]</span>require anything as my right. I only
implore you to listen to the wish that is dearest to my heart. I do not
ask any promise for the future. I give you the fullest liberty; but let
me remain with you for the present, even if it is for a short time. It
is impossible for me to part with you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and never!&rdquo; answered Siddha, sternly. &ldquo;No
hesitation, no weakness; once for all, leave me and forget me.&rdquo;
And pushing Iravati, who went on before him, he prepared to hurry away,
so that he might never again see her whom until this moment he had
never loved so tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be so,&rdquo; said Iravati, rising up, with an injured
feeling of self-respect, and speaking with a firm voice; &ldquo;let it
be so, you are perhaps right. You make yourself unworthy of my love.
Once, in spite of your promises, you have been unfaithful to me, but
that I had forgotten and forgiven; for I knew you had been led away by
temptation unknown to me. But now you drive me from you, not because I
have committed any fault, but because you are too proud to confess to
your wife that you have once been weak and unable to withstand
temptation. Leave me, then. Without you my life is without value; but a
forced love no woman can seek, not even from the man she loves. And
now, to the memory of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href=
"#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>the crime you have been guilty of
against a friend, add the memory of a woman whom you loved, yet
sacrificed to your selfish pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Siddha hesitated. Should he go, or stay? The latter he would gladly
do, but how could he reconcile it with honour? &ldquo;Who shall
decide?&rdquo; he said, striking his forehead with his hand.
&ldquo;There is truth in what you say, though it is in conflict with
what I consider right. Yet,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;another, who is
wiser than either of us, shall decide between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Kulluka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not him. Highly as I prize his opinion, I know beforehand
that he would only try to secure our happiness, and, to do so, would
decide that you are right. He would not be impartial in his judgment.
There is another; but do not ask me further. He alone can I trust to
decide between us; and he will advise me. Listen, then, Iravati; let me
depart hence as speedily as possible. Perhaps I shall return soon,
perhaps never. Should I return, then my life shall henceforth be
devoted to you. If not, then understand that you will never see me
more, and that you are freed from all ties that bind you to me. Do not
raise objections, but have patience with me, such as, till now, you
have always shown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Iravati could reply to this new and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>unexpected proposal, Siddha had disappeared to
seek his servant, and to order his horse to be saddled, so as to set
out on their journey, his destination being unknown to her.</p>
<p>Iravati hastened to Kulluka, and told him all that had passed, and
Siddha&rsquo;s extraordinary determination; but the guru, seeing that
it was better to let Siddha take his own way and not to oppose him,
tried to console Iravati with the hope that she would soon see him
again. In the meantime Siddha had taken leave of the Buddhist priest,
giving him a rich present for the benefit of the monastery, and then,
followed by Vatsa, had ridden away.</p>
<p>Again the last rays of the setting sun fell on the slopes of the
Him&aacute;layas, and again Siddha, accompanied by Vatsa, followed the
path that led to the valley where the habitation of Gurupada was
situated. He was received by the old servant, who quickly recognised
him, and without delay led him to his master.</p>
<p>The hermit welcomed his young friend with pleasure, but saw with
concern the change that had taken place in his appearance. His face,
once so full of joy and life, was now pale, and had assumed a sad and
dark expression; and his whole bearing had lost its former elasticity.
In but a short time the youth had become a man, and not one full of
life and strength, but one bowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331"
href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>down under the weight of
sorrow, which Gurupada&rsquo;s sharp sight told him was the heaviest
that falls to the lot of man, that of self-reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most revered,&rdquo; said Siddha, after the first greetings;
&ldquo;or let me rather say, most gracious
prince&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted the hermit; &ldquo;continue to call me
Gurupada, for I am nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I obey,&rdquo; said Siddha, &ldquo;and I see with joy that
you have not forgotten me. Perhaps you still remember the last words
you said to me, when, after a short visit to your hospitable dwelling,
we took our leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made you promise,&rdquo; replied Gurupada, &ldquo;to seek
me again if it should ever chance in your life that you should need the
counsel of a true friend; and I understand that this is the reason
which now brings you here. If I may judge from your looks, the cause of
your coming is a very bitter one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Siddha; &ldquo;and when you have
heard all, you will wonder that my appearance does not more clearly
proclaim my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said Gurupada, &ldquo;to the other side of
the house; there we will seat ourselves, and talk quietly of all that
has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Siddha gladly accepted the invitation, and after having, at the
earnest request of the hermit, partaken of some refreshment, he began
to recount <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>all that had happened until the moment of his
parting with Iravati in the cloister.</p>
<p>Gurupada listened with the deepest attention and interest; and when
the tale was finished he remained for some moments silent, sunk in
thought; but at last, looking at Siddha, he said: &ldquo;In truth you
have laden yourself with a heavy burthen, but not so heavy as that a
man cannot bear it. That you allowed yourself to be led away by
Gulbadan is not to be defended, although it may be excusable; but that
you did not part from her, after discovering who she was, was an
inexcusable offence against your friendship with Faizi. Your original
faithlessness towards the Emperor was partly the result of an error;
but to remain in his service and to conspire against him was a crime. I
do not judge your conduct more leniently than you do yourself; on the
contrary, I judge it still more harshly. You believe that the tale of
your faults was closed when you confessed your crimes to the Emperor.
But you deceive yourself, you began to commit another, which may be
just as unfortunate as those which preceded it, although you were led
into it by an error. The greater part of mankind imagine with you that
repentance is a virtue, and that by penance and self-punishment alone
can sin be washed away. But few errors are so ruinous in their result
as this, when penance consists in the penitent&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>withdrawal from the circle in which he can
labour usefully, and when also he punishes others as well as himself.
And this is what you would do. First, you sought death on the field of
battle, which was the simplest place, as you would not lay violent
hands on your own life. But what good would your death have produced,
or how could it undo the ill you have done? Unable to find an
honourable death, you declare your intention of living a solitary life
in the jungle, devoted to prayer and penance; but for what? How could
this serve yourself or others? And then Iravati, your bride! you desert
her, not because she is faithless to you, but because you have cause to
feel shame in her presence. Thus you punish her more than yourself. Do
you call that duty and virtue? No, my friend, such a course would end
in being worse than an error. You look at me with astonishment; but the
course you propose would be one of pride and defiance, because you know
that you have lowered yourself. Iravati was right; you were too proud
to bind yourself to a woman who knew all your weaknesses, and who had
nothing to reproach herself with; and it is indeed pride that prompts
you to fly the world. You fear to meet some one acquainted with your
former evil deeds. You dare not look a man in the face, for fear of
what he may know of you. Is that, I ask, virtue and courage? is it not,
rather, a cowardly weakness?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But Faizi&rsquo;s last words,&rdquo; said Siddha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I foresaw that objection,&rdquo; continued Gurupada;
&ldquo;and I do not deny that it has a certain weight. But let us
beware of exaggeration. That Faizi should have acted and spoken as he
did is easily to be understood in his place. You probably would have
done the same; and he, were he in my place, and had to decide
impartially, would doubtless say as I do. A man need not spend his life
bowed down in humiliation because in an evil hour he has been guilty of
a shameful deed, when his after life has been spent so as to gain the
respect of his fellow-men. Now listen to the counsel you ask of me,
which I willingly give. You have arrived at the full consciousness of
the wickedness of your conduct, and you have accused yourself before
the Emperor, before Iravati, and before me. That was well done; but the
knowledge and clear insight of your evil-doing must not be the last
step, but the first, in the right path. It should restrain you from all
errors, not only those of the same class that have already led you
astray, but also from others. It should teach you to keep better watch
over yourself, your impressions, your passions. You should have greater
dread of deeds which you could not confess to others without shame; and
in the end you should attain to a state of mind which will make it
impossible for you to act against duty <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>or honour. But this
cannot be if you seek to avoid temptation by flying from it. Resist
temptation, and begin in the first place by conquering your own pride.
Therefore take Iravati for your wife, and render yourself worthy of
her. Go to the Emperor, and pray him to entrust you with some work by
which you may serve your country; I doubt not but that he will
willingly grant your request. I understand that you desire to avoid
Faizi, and that is well; you owe it to him to spare him any meeting,
and Hindustan is large enough to keep two men apart. In Kashmir, or in
other places, you may render as good service as in Agra itself. Think
over this, and, after reflection, let me know what your decision
is.&mdash;No, no, do not answer me at once,&rdquo; said Gurupada,
seeing Siddha ready with his reply; &ldquo;take the repose of which I
see you have need, and to-morrow, when you have thoroughly weighed all
I have said, tell me if you still see difficulties in following the
advice I have given.&rdquo; And with a friendly greeting the hermit
left Siddha to his own thoughts.</p>
<p>The next day Siddha was ready to take farewell of Gurupada, perhaps
for the last time. For a long while the two men stood in earnest
conversation, and as at last the traveller turned to mount his horse,
he warmly pressed his host&rsquo;s hand, saying, with a trembling
voice, but with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336"
name="pb336">336</a>]</span>countenance cleared from all trouble,
&ldquo;I thank you, Gurupada, for the manly advice you have given me; I
owe you a new life, and I hope to bear myself in it very differently
from what I have done in the past, which I shall never forget. You have

<p class="first">In the neighbourhood of the village of Sikandra rises
that magnificent building, the tasteful splendour of which is the pride
of Hindustan, while it awakens the admiration of all travellers, and is
one of the last memorials of the departed greatness of the Mughals. A
wall with many towers gave entrance, through a broad gateway of red
marble, to a path lined with shady trees, above which rose a building
of majestic height and of great circumference. This building excited
admiration, not alone by the stern beauty of its outline, but also by
the richly-wrought gateways, minarets, cupolas both high and low, and
open galleries, by which it was surrounded, giving it more the
appearance of a number of palaces and pleasure-houses than of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>monument. However, it was not destined for the
abode of the living, but to preserve the memory of the illustrious
dead,&mdash;of Akbar himself.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4319src" href=
"#xd20e4319" name="xd20e4319src">1</a></p>
<p>A few years after the occurrences already narrated, a silent pair
stood in this park: a powerful man, in rich attire, one hand resting on
the hilt of his sword, while the right was thrown <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>round a lovely woman who stood beside him,
looking like the graceful ivy that clings to the oak. It was Siddha
Rama, accompanied by Iravati. They stood lost in admiration before the
tomb, and thought of the man of whom they had so often spoken with the
greatest reverence.</p>
<p>Much had happened in these few years. Akbar was no more, and in his
place reigned his son Salim, who, in accordance with the wish of his
father as he lay on his dying bed, had girded on the sword the Emperor
had always worn, and who was now, under the name of Jahangir, the
Emperor of Hindustan.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4331src" href=
"#xd20e4331" name="xd20e4331src">2</a> That he was not to be compared
to Akbar was to be expected, still his reign was not bad; and it fell
to the lot of his successors&mdash;to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>Shah Jahan<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e4336src" href="#xd20e4336" name="xd20e4336src">3</a>
and Aurangz&iacute;b<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4339src" href=
"#xd20e4339" name="xd20e4339src">4</a>&mdash;so to corrupt the formerly
powerful empire, as that it fell an easy prey into the hands of British
conquerors.</p>
<p>Salim had not entirely laid aside his evil habits, and Sir Thomas
Roe, the English ambassador, had an opportunity of seeing him in much
the same situation as Siddha had done, at the banquet given in his
palace. Still he was not the hopeless drunkard that he had appeared to
be.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4344src" href="#xd20e4344" name=
"xd20e4344src">5</a> To Iravati he had kept his word, and in spite of
his disappointment, found himself happy in his marriage with the wise
and beautiful Mahal, whose influence over him was great, and always for
good.</p>
<p>That Kashmir must in the end submit, had long been foreseen; and
after the failure of Salim&rsquo;s conspiracy, it cost Akbar but little
trouble to penetrate through the ruined country and force it to come
under his rule. The weak king died, his unworthy sons were banished,
and Siddha&rsquo;s father was made Vice-King, Siddha receiving an
important appointment, with the understanding that he should succeed to
the Viceroyship; while Kulluka, faithful as ever, was always ready with
counsel and advice. It was not long before the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>people began to appreciate the blessing and
prosperity of a wise and settled rule.</p>
<p>The hermit of Badari-Natha did not long survive the subjection of
his country. Once, when Kulluka went to visit him, he found the servant
alone. His master had become suddenly unwell. He died in a few days,
and was buried on the heights overlooking Kashmir. Hara, the tiger,
laid himself down on the grave, and growled fiercely when the servant
sought to entice him back to the house. He refused the food and water
brought to him, and in a few days was lying dead on the grave of his
friend and master.</p>
<p>Parviz knew nothing of the affair with Gulbadan, and Siddha
occasionally received good news from him. He was happy in his marriage
with the daughter of the Treasurer, and though in high office, was busy
in arranging the literary and diplomatic papers of Ab&uacute;-l Fazl,
his deeply lamented uncle.</p>
<p>Abdul Kadir held himself aloof from public life, and though wiser,
was still an earnest enthusiast for the true faith. He sought
consolation for his many disappointments in writing his
history,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4357src" href="#xd20e4357" name=
"xd20e4357src">6</a> in which he complained bitterly of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>Akbar, and railed at Ab&uacute;-l Fazl and
Faizi, although they had never harmed him.</p>
<p>Padre Aquaviva did not return to Agra, but others came to continue
his work, with as little success. Though three centuries have passed,
the conversion of Hindustan remains the dream of western zealots.</p>
<p>Whether the faithful Vatsa espoused the talkative but good-hearted
Nipunika, history says not; but it is very probable that they followed
the example of their master and mistress. The happiness of these two
was unbroken, though dark memories often arose in Siddha&rsquo;s mind.
But by degrees he had learnt not to allow himself to be weighed down by
them, and to hide his regrets from Iravati. He had remarked how deeply
it grieved her when his countenance was clouded with gloomy thoughts of
the past, the cause of which she well understood, for he had confessed
all to her. Soon after their marriage she had given him a son, whom he
loved nearly as much as herself. He understood how great a treasure he
had won, when he heard of Salim&rsquo;s wishes, and what her answer had
been; but when he expressed his admiration, she only replied that in
her place every woman would have acted in the same manner.</p>
<p>Siddha remained long lost in thought before Akbar&rsquo;s tomb, when
his attention was roused <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href=
"#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>by an approaching footstep. In
dismay he stepped back as he recognised who drew near; and the
exclamation which broke from him told Iravati what an unhappy meeting
had chanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faizi!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>He who, lost in thought, was passing them, suddenly stood still, and
then drew back, as he recognised the man who had so deeply injured him.
But, changing his mind, he slowly advanced, and as he saw Siddha
preparing hastily to withdraw, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remain, and listen to me. Here, by the tomb of the prince who
ever more willingly forgave than punished his enemies, and who did not
know what hate was, I should feel no anger. I have often striven to
follow his noble example, and to forgive the wrong you have done me. I
could not, I had not the strength; but now, on this holy spot, where
accident has brought us together, I have found strength to do what
Akbar in my place would have done. I forgive you, Siddha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply touched, and with bowed head, Siddha stood before his noble
enemy, while Iravati gazed with admiration on the man who in such a
strife had been victor over himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up,&rdquo; continued Faizi; &ldquo;no longer avoid the
sight of your former friend. The words that I addressed to you in my
anger were not undeserved, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href=
"#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>but to a man of your character
they were a fearful and perhaps too severe a punishment; and I know
from Kulluka what an influence they have had on you, and to what wild
actions they nearly drove you. From our friend I learnt that in the
first place you were not the tempter, nor in the beginning did you know
who the tempter was. Her great influence and power I know well myself;
but she is no longer to be feared. In her captivity she herself made an
end to her guilty life. Enough of the past, especially in the presence
of her whom I must greet as your noble consort. Let the past, then, be
forgotten by us. What I have since heard of you, has made you again
worthy of the respect and friendship of a man of honour. Take, then, my
hand, as of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Iravati who clasped it, while Siddha could scarcely conquer
his emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;from my heart, for your
generosity. What you have said has lifted the dark cloud that
overshadowed our married happiness, and the leaden weight is at last
removed which for so long has weighed my Siddha down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seek for words,&rdquo; at last said Siddha; &ldquo;but
words to express what at this moment I feel are not to be found. Once I
thought myself comforted and strengthened by the words of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>wise man, and as though I were born to a new
life; but now I feel the new birth for the first time. Your friendship,
Faizi, was always most deeply prized by me, and all the bitterer was my
self-reproach, and the harder my punishment, to lose it so shamefully,
and through my own fault. The friendship that you give me back so
nobly, I esteem as the highest gift I could receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our present accidental meeting,&rdquo; replied Faizi,
&ldquo;must be of short duration, and in all probability it will be our
last. That I have withdrawn from the service of the State is already
known to you. Salim, or, as he likes better to be called by his proud
title, Jahangir, never looked upon me or my brother with a favourable
eye; besides, I should find it hard to serve him, for reasons which you
need not that I should explain, and so I withdrew myself from public
life, and lived retired at Agra. But now Shah Abbas, King of Persia,
has invited me to his capital, and to occupy myself there with literary
studies.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4393src" href="#xd20e4393" name=
"xd20e4393src">7</a> This invitation I have accepted. I start for
Ispahan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>to-morrow, and I may remain there. But I could
not leave this country without a farewell visit to the last
resting-place of my princely friend&mdash;the friend who was everything
to me, Siddha, more than life or happiness; and had you sinned against
him, I do not believe that I could ever have pardoned it. But you have
shown that you honoured and prized him, though you never had the
opportunity of knowing him intimately, as but few did, both in his
greatness and his weaknesses, which were still loveable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; rejoined Siddha, &ldquo;I never learnt to
know him closely, but I have known enough to awaken my deepest
admiration and reverence. I knew another prince whose life has ended,
to whom I owed a debt of gratitude, and his memory is dear to me; but
if I was asked which was the greatest, I am now convinced that the
secluded philosopher, who had said farewell to all worldly joys, was
surpassed by the philosopher on his throne, who in the midst of the
wildest divisions and disturbances knew how to preserve the same
evenness of character and uprightness of mind. In truth Akbar deserves
his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that shall be said by all coming generations,&rdquo;
replied Faizi, &ldquo;both in the East and West. The title of
&lsquo;the Great&rsquo; has been given by favourites and flatterers to
many a prince, but with little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347"
href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>right. To be truly great
means that a ruler knows how to govern himself as well as others, and
to give up his life to sorrow and trouble for the welfare of his
fellow-men; and it was in this that he who rests yonder was great.
There have been princes, and there still may be more, whose names in
the world&rsquo;s history will be better known than his; and it is
possible that there may be those who will win still higher fame, but
seldom in history can one point to the name of a ruler who, in the
midst of his greatness, knew, like Akbar, how to remain a man in the
most beautiful and noblest meaning of the word. And now,&rdquo;
concluded Faizi, clasping the hands of Siddha and Iravati,
&ldquo;farewell. Think of me sometimes, when I am far from here. You
can do so now without bitterness; and this also takes from me a burden
which I have often found hard to bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time after Faizi had left them, Siddha and Iravati remained
in the park. At last they left the spot where they had come to render a
last silent homage to the memory of the Great Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they all pass away,&rdquo; said Siddha, musingly, as they
turned towards home; &ldquo;all we have learnt to know and reverence.
He who has just left us, in all probability we shall see no more. But
such men as Akbar, Faizi, and Ab&uacute;-l Fazl do not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>die
when death ends their lives here; they live in the memory they leave
us, and in their works. The thought of them animates those who come
after them; and is not that true immortality?&rdquo;</p>

died in October 1605, aged sixty-three. There is grave suspicion that
he was poisoned at the instigation of his son Salim, who ascended the
throne under the name of Jahangir. He was buried at Sikandra, about
four miles from Agra, and a splendid mausoleum was erected over his
grave. The building was commenced by himself; and Mr. Fergusson says
that it is quite unlike any other tomb built in India either before or
since, and of a design borrowed from a Hindu or Buddhist model. It
stands in an extensive garden, and is approached by one noble gateway.
In the centre of the garden, on a raised platform, stands the tomb, of
a pyramidal form. The lower storey measures 320 feet each way,
exclusive of the angle towers. It is thirty feet high, and is pierced
by ten great arches on each face, with a larger entrance in the centre.
On this terrace stands another far more ornate, measuring 186 feet on
each side, and fourteen feet nine inches in height. A third and fourth
of similar design stand on this, all being of red sandstone. Within and
above the last is a white marble enclosure, its outer wall entirely
composed of marble trellis work of the most beautiful patterns. Inside
is the tombstone, a splendid piece of arabesque tracery. But the mortal
remains repose under a plainer stone in a vaulted chamber in the
basement.&mdash;Fergusson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Indian Architecture,&rdquo; p.
583.</p>
<p class="footnote">The Earl of Northbrook, when Viceroy of India,
presented a rich carpet to the tomb at Sikandra, to be placed over the
stone which covers the remains of the greatest ruler of India.</p>

under the name of Jahangir, reigned from 1605 to 1627. His mother was a
Rajp&uacute;t. He was cruel, avaricious, and debauched. He suppressed
the rebellion of his son Khusru with the most horrible cruelties. In
1608 Captain William Hawkins landed at Surat, and was received with
great favour by Jahangir at Agra. But, after two years, he failed in
securing trading privileges for the East India Company, and left Agra
in 1611. The influence of Nur Mahal, his favourite wife, was paramount
over Jahangir; but he had no children by her. Of his four sons, he kept
the eldest, Khusru, in prison for rebellion. Parwiz, the second, was a
drunkard. Khurram, afterwards known as Shah Jahan, succeeded his
father. Shahryar was the youngest. In 1615 Sir Thomas Roe arrived at
the court of Jahangir, as ambassador from James I., and remained until
1618. Jahangir died on October 12th, 1627, and was succeeded by his
rebellious son as Shah Jahan.</p>

<p>A RELIEVO MAP OF INDIA.</p>
<p>BY</p>
<p>HENRY F. BRION.</p>
<p><i>In Frame, 21s.</i></p>
<p>A map of this kind brings before us such a picture of the surface of
a given country as no ordinary map could ever do. To the mind&rsquo;s
eye of the average Englishman, India consists of &lsquo;the
plains&rsquo; and &lsquo;the hills,&rsquo; chiefly of the former, the
hills being limited to the Himalayas and the Nilgiris. The new map will
at least enable him to correct his notions of Indian geography. It
combines the usual features of a good plain map of the country on a
scale of 150 miles to the inch, with a faithful representation of all
the uneven surfaces, modelled on a scale thirty-two times the
horizontal one; thus bringing out into clear relief the comparative
heights and outlines of all the hill-ranges, and showing broad tracts
of uneven ground, of intermingled hill and valley, which a common map
of the same size would hardly indicate, except to a very practised eye.
The plains of Upper India are reduced to their true proportions; the
Central Provinces, Malwa, and Western Bengal reveal their actual
ruggedness at a glance; and Southern India, from the Vindhyas to Cape
Comorin, proclaims its real height above the sea-level. To the
historical as well as the geographical student such a map is an obvious
and important aid in tracing the course of past campaigns, in realising
the conditions under which successive races carried their arms or
settlements through the Peninsula, and in comprehending the difference
of race, climate, and physical surroundings which make up our Indian
Empire. Set in a neat frame of maplewood, the map seems to attract the
eye like a prettily-coloured picture, and its price, a guinea, should
place it within the reach of all who care to combine the useful with
the ornamental.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Home News.</i> <span class=
